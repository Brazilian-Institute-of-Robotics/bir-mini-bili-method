abstract={The articulated intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (AIAUV) is an underwater swimming manipulator with intervention capabilities. Station-keeping and trajectory tracking are essential for the AIAUV to be able to move in confined spaces and to perform intervention tasks. In this article, we propose using a generalized super-twisting algorithm (GSTA), which is an extension of the regular super-twisting algorithm, for the trajectory tracking of the position and orientation of the base of the AIAUV in six degrees of freedom (6DOF). We also propose using a higher-order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) for estimating the linear and angular velocities when velocity measurements are unavailable. Furthermore, we show the ultimate boundedness of the tracking errors for a control law using the GSTA and for a control law that combines the GSTA with an HOSMO. We also prove that the GSTA gives global uniform finite-time stability. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed control laws with comprehensive simulation and experimental results. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This research focuses on bio-inspired modeling and control system of an underwater flexible manipulator system (UFM). The dynamic behavior of the UFM was first modeled using system identification (SI) methods utilizing bio-inspired algorithms. The input–output data used for identification were acquired directly from a laboratory-sized UFM experimental rig developed earlier by the previous researcher. The models were developed using cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and flower pollination algorithm (FPA) using parametric ARX model structured. For the controllers of the UFM, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers were tuned using conventional heuristic and intelligent FPA methods. These algorithms were utilized to obtain the optimal values of controller parameters for trajectory tracking control of rigid-body motion of the UFM system. The PID controller is tuned offline based on the best identified SI model. The performance of these control schemes was analyzed via real-time PC-based control and observed in terms of trajectory tracking and error. The overall result of UFM described in this research revealed the superiority of the PID controllers tuned using bio-inspired flower pollination algorithm (FPA). It was found that the percentage of improvement achieved experimentally by the PID controller tuned by FPA indicates superiority compared to PID tuned heuristically with 45.6% improvement on overshoot and 66% improvement of MSE for negative pulse and 100% improvement on overshoot for positive pulse. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={In order to solve the influence of external disturbance of ocean current and uncertainty of system parameters on the control stability and tracking accuracy of underwater manipulator, an ADRC (Active Disturbance Rejection Control) control method based on terminal sliding mode is proposed. This method is insensitive to hydrodynamic parameter change and flow disturbance, and has strong robustness. It uses saturation function instead of sign function to make control signal more stable and control output more gentle. The reliability, stability and robustness of the proposed control method are verified by simulating the actual underwater situation and simulating the controller under different conditions, such as current environment and external disturbance environment. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This work is the second part of a survey devoted to disturbance observers that appeared in the theory and practice of automatic control back in the mid-1960s. The first part of the survey was devoted to theoretical results. This part of the survey is devoted to practical application of disturbance observers. We consider such applications as control of ships and underwater vehicles, control of aircraft and robotic manipulators, suppression of narrow-band vibrational oscillations, estimation and suppression of disturbances in electrical systems, control of cars and their component units, and a number of other applications. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, a fuzzy sliding mode active disturbance rejection control (FSMADRC) scheme is proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (AUVMS) with a two-link and three-joint manipulator. First, the AUVMS is separated into nine subsystems, and the combined effects of dynamic uncertainties, hydrodynamic force, unknown disturbances, and nonlinear coupling terms on each subsystem are lumped into a single total disturbance. Next, a linear extended state observer (LESO) is presented to estimate the total disturbance. Then, a sliding mode active disturbance rejection control (SMADRC) scheme is proposed to enhance the robustness of the control system. The stability of the SMADRC and the estimation errors of the LESO are analyzed. Because it is difficult to simultaneously adjust several parameters for a LESO-based SMADRC scheme, a fuzzy logic control (FLC) scheme is used to formulate the FSMADRC to determine the appropriate parameters adaptively for practical applications. Finally, two AUVMS tasks are illustrated to test the trajectory tracking performance of the closed-loop system and its ability to reject and attenuate the total disturbance. The simulation results show that the proposed FSMADRC scheme achieves better performance and consume less energy than conventional PID and FLC techniques. © 2020, Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={In this paper, a design method of extended state observer (ESO)-based sliding mode control is proposed for underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs) with prescribed performance. First, the system model is reformulated by lumping the unknown uncertainties and disturbances into a total disturbance. Then, an ESO is developed to estimate the total disturbance. Based on ESO, the prescribed performance is defined to limit upper bounds of tracking error and then a sliding mode controller is proposed to ensure that all the signals are ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). Moreover, the tracking errors can converge to the neighborhood of zero in finite-time and satisfy the prescribed performances. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Optics-based systems may provide high spatial and temporal resolution for close range object detection in underwater environments. By using a monocular camera on a low cost underwater vehicle manipulator system, objects can be tracked by the vehicle and handled by the manipulator. In this paper, a monocular camera is used to detect an object of interest through object detection. Spatial features of the object are extracted, and a dynamic positioning system is designed for the underwater vehicle in order for it to maintain a desired position relative to the object. A manipulator mounted under the vehicle is used to retrieve the object through a developed kinematic control system. Experimental tests verify the proposed methodology. A stability analysis proves asymptotic stability properties for the chosen sliding mode controller and exponential stability for the task error. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={This article presents the design of a biomimetic underwater vehicle-manipulator system (BUVMS) with bioinspired long-fin propulsion and its control methods. The kinematic analysis of bioinspired long-fin propulsion is conducted, and the maximum thrust of this propulsion derived from our thrust measurement platform can be up to 25 N. Bioinspired long-fin propulsion is introduced to construct the BUVMS for inspection and manipulation tasks, and the system architecture of the BUVMS is described. Moreover, real-Time dynamic dubins-helix path planning and tracking of the biomimetic vehicle are proposed to realize the arrival of the desired pose. The tracking error is less than 0.23 body length. Finally, coordinated control between the biomimetic vehicle and the manipulator is developed to achieve autonomous manipulation. The reaction of the manipulator served as feedforward compensation is added into the closed-loop control of the biomimetic vehicle. The experimental results are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed methods. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A key challenge in autonomous mobile manipulation is the ability to determine, in real time, how to safely execute complex tasks when placed in unknown or changing world. Addressing this issue for Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUVs), operating in potentially unstructured environment is becoming essential. Our research focuses on using motion planning to increase the I-AUVs autonomy, and on addressing three major challenges: (a) producing consistent deterministic trajectories, (b) addressing the high dimensionality of the system and its impact on the real-time response, and (c) coordinating the motion between the floating vehicle and the arm. The latter challenge is of high importance to achieve the accuracy required for manipulation, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV and the control challenges that come with it. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate experimental results performing manipulation in unknown environment. The Multirepresentation, Multiheuristic A* (MR-MHA*) search-based planner, previously tested only in simulation and in a known a priori environment, is now extended to control Girona500 I-AUV performing a Valve-Turning intervention in a water tank. To this aim, the AUV was upgraded with an in-house-developed laser scanner to gather three-dimensional (3D) point clouds for building, in real time, an occupancy grid map (octomap) of the environment. The MR-MHA* motion planner used this octomap to plan, in real time, collision-free trajectories. To achieve the accuracy required to complete the task, a vision-based navigation method was employed. In addition, to reinforce the safety, accounting for the localization uncertainty, a cost function was introduced to keep minimum clearance in the planning. Moreover a visual-servoing method had to be implemented to complete the last step of the manipulation with the desired accuracy. Lastly, we further analyzed the approach performance from both loose-coupling and clearance perspectives. Our results show the success and efficiency of the approach to meet the desired behavior, as well as the ability to adapt to unknown environments. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={A vehicle-manipulator system (VMS) is a class of mobile robots characterised by their ability to carry or be a robotic arm and therefore also manipulate objects. The VMS class includes vehicles with a robotic manipulator, free-floating space robots, aerial manipulators and underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMSs). All of these systems need a kinematic controller to solve the kinematic redundancy of the VMS and a dynamic controller to follow the reference given by the kinematic controller. In this paper, we propose a combined kinematic and dynamic control approach for VMSs. The approach uses the singularity-robust multiple task-priority (SRMTP) framework to generate a velocity reference combined with a dynamic velocity controller based on a robust sliding mode controller (SMC). Any SMC can be used as long as it can make the velocity vector converge to the velocity reference vector in finite time. This novel approach allows us to analyse the stability properties of the kinematic and dynamic subsystems together in the presence of model uncertainty. We show that the multiple set-point regulation tasks will converge asymptotically to zero without the strict requirement that the velocities are perfectly controlled. This novel approach thus avoids the assumption of perfect dynamic control that is common in kinematic stability analyses for robot manipulators. We present two examples of SMCs that can make the velocity vector converge to the velocity reference vector in finite time. We also demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach through a simulation study of an articulated intervention-AUV (AIAUV), which is a type of UVMS, by conducting three simultaneous tasks. The results show that both SMC algorithms can make all the regulation tasks converge to their respective set-points. In the simulation study, we also include the results from two standard control methods, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and a feedback linearisation controller, and we use two different AIAUVs to illustrate the advantages and robustness achieved from using SMC. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={A nonlinear robust control method for the trajectory tracking of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system that operates in the presence of external current disturbances is proposed using double closed-loop integral sliding mode control. The designed controller uses a double closed-loop control structure to track the desired trajectory in the joint space of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system, and its inner and outer loop systems use integral sliding surface to enhance the robustness of the whole system. Then, the continuous switching mode based on hyperbolic tangent function is used instead of the traditional discontinuous switching mode to reduce the chattering of the control input of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system. In addition, the control method proposed in this article does not need to estimate the uncertainties of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system control system through online identification, but also can ensure the robustness of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system motion control in underwater environment. Therefore, it is easier to be implemented on the embedded platform of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system and applied to the actual marine operation tasks. At last, the stability of the control system is proved by the Lyapunov theory, and its effectiveness and feasibility are verified by the simulation experiments in MATLAB software. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={This paper addresses the trajectory tracking problem for the constrained dynamical underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties, sensory measurement noises, and time-varying external disturbances. An adaptive robust fast computational optimal control scheme is presented for the large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) constrained dynamical UVMS. The structure of our proposed scheme is based on a fast incremental model predictive controller (MPC) embedded with an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The EKF estimation part is used to compensate the unmodeled uncertainties, sensory noises, and external disturbances. The fast MPC (FMPC) part is a trajectory-tracking controller designed by the terminal constrained MPC with an approximately fast computational cost function, which guarantees the optimal batch control process satisfying the state and input constraints. By resorting to a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FMPC is proved to be asymptotically stable with a monotonic decrease in the cost function, and can guarantee the tracking performance of the constrained dynamical UVMS. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified through a series of comparative simulations of a six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) vehicle-6DOF manipulator system. © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to avoid the vibration shock caused by the full extension of the manipulator of autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (AUVMS), a coordinated motion planning method based on virtual workspace constraints is proposed. A certain subset of the flexible workspace of the manipulator is selected as the virtual workspace in order to constraint the motion of the end effector. The soft joint limits is used to avoid self-interference, and the positional relationship between the end effector and the virtual workspace is determined by ray detection algorithm based on convex hull. The vehicle command velocity corresponding to the different self-movement states of AUVMS is deduced, so as to move the vehicle as little as possible. The results show that the proposed method not only solves the problem of the fully extended of the manipulator, but makes the tracking accuracy improved compared to the weighted minimum norm method. The position error is within ± 0.04 m, and the orientation error is within ± 3 °. © 2020 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

abstract={This paper presents new motion planning and robust coordinated control schemes for trajectory tracking of the underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) subjected to model uncertainties, time-varying external disturbances, payload and sensory noises. A redundancy resolution technique with a new secondary task and nonlinear function is proposed to generate trajectories for the vehicle and manipulator. In this way, the vehicle attitude and manipulator position are aligned in such a way that the interactive forces are reduced. To resist sensory measurement noises, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is utilized to estimate the UVMS states. Using these estimates, a tracking controller based on feedback Linearization with both the joint-space and task-space tracking errors is proposed. Moreover, the inertial delay control (IDC) is incorporated in the proposed control scheme to estimate the lumped uncertainties and disturbances. In addition, a fuzzy compensator based on these estimates via IDC is introduced for reducing the undesired effects of perturbations. Trajectory tracking tasks on a five-degrees-of-freedom (5-DOF) underwater vehicle equipped with a 3-DOF manipulator are numerically simulated. The comparative results demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller in terms of tracking errors, energy consumption and robustness against uncertainties and disturbances. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={In order to compensate the centroid variability of the underwater welding vehicle (named HITUWV) caused by the movements of the 3-DOF (degree of freedom) Cartesian-type manipulator, a centroid-variability model based adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed. Firstly, a centroid variability model (CVM) of HITUWV is established to describe the centroid variability characteristics of HITUWV accurately. Then, a centroid-variability model based adaptive sliding-mode controller (CVM-ASMC) is designed, to realize a high-accuracy compensation of the centroid variability. Experimental results indicate that the proposed CVM-ASMC demonstrates a higher accuracy, a better stability and a lower power consumption than the conventional PID (proportional-integral-differential) controller and the model-based PID controller. As a result, CVM-ASMC can meet the control requirement of underwater operation with high stability and accuracy. © 2020, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={Continuum manipulator offers superior flexibility, deformability and adaptability to the environment, which makes it ideally suitable for safe interaction and for applications in confined spaces. Owning these advantages, the continuum manipulator gains increasing interests in the fields of surgical, underwater, inspection, etc. This paper introduces a novel continuum manipulator, which is designed as an independent and auxiliary modular for bringing extra dexterity and reachability to different rigid platforms. With the aim at precisely calculating the gripper pose of the manipulator, a probabilistic model-based approach is used, which learns a mapping among the actuator space and task space from experiments by using dynamic mixture of Gaussians. The learned model and the control approach are validated with the help of a 3D trajectory tracking system. Finally, to test the versatility and reliability of the manipulator, we mount the actuation base of the continuum manipulator to a rigid manipulator, which are then used to manipulate an object in a confined space. The results of the experiments show that the proposed continuum manipulator can be controlled effectively by using a learned probabilistic model and the dexterity and workspace of a robotic system could be enhanced significantly by soft-rigid arm collaboration. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The joint control problem of the underwater manipulator is addressed in this paper, under the influence of uncertainty factors such as model uncertainty, external disturbance, and manipulator joint lag. In general, for the uncertainty factors, it is usually approximated online, but it is difficult to select a reasonable value for the approximation error boundary, too conservative estimated values would cause chattering problem easily. And the influence of joint lag on the manipulator control should be considered in actual work. Unlike most previous control method, in this paper, the function approximation technique (FAT), which uses the Legendre polynomial, is adopted to approximate the uncertainty factors online. Then, based on the proportion integral differential (PID) sliding manifold with the integral and differential of tracking error, a sliding model PID controller is designed to speed up the response and reduce the effects of joint lag. For the error boundary, the adaptive law is proposed, and it will reduce chattering of the control quantity under the steady state of the system. It was proved that the joint error of the control system is uniformly asymptotic convergence through the stability analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with pool comparison experiments of the underwater manipulator installed in the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper describes a novel approach for the control of underwater robots that can handle uncertainties and disturbance problems, which are commonly met in underwater environments. The considered system is an underwater manipulator with n-degrees of freedom. The approximation capability of an adaptive neural network is exploited to estimate uncertainties in system dynamics. Drag and lift forces are considered as an external disturbance, and a disturbance observer approach which has been proved to be effective with on-land robotic systems, is applied to compensate for it. The objective of the controller designed is to track a desired trajectory. To find the optimal gain parameters of this controller, a classical Genetic Algorithm is employed. Extensive simulation studies carried out on a two degrees of freedom manipulator indicate the efficacy of the proposed approach, proving that the disturbance observer originally developed for on-land systems can also be used effectively for underwater robotic systems. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller, tuned by the Genetic Algorithm is compared with that of a controller, tuned manually. The results show that the reliance on a well-known classic Genetic Algorithm for the tuning of the controller parameters not only saves time, but also provides better values of the parameters. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={With the deepening of ocean development, the tasks that underwater vehicles need to perform are more complex. Shared control provides a reliable scheme for robots to accomplish these tasks under teleoperation. At present, most of the underwater vehicles are equipped with traditional mechanical manipulator, which is challenging to realize the application of shared control. So, we developed a highly humanoid underwater robot for shared control. The robot is equipped with two humanoid arms. It can be remotely controlled by the operator through the full ocean depth optical fiber, and can also realize simple task planning based on its control system. We have realized and improved the auxiliary function in the operation room, such as motion capture, data fusion, etc. We built detailed modelling and simulation analysis of the robot, and used the sliding mode controller to achieve the stability control of the robot. Its reliability has been verified in the simulation and experiment. Finally, the robot completed the task autonomously in the offline state and showed a better control effect and stronger task completion ability under the shared control. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, an adaptive nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control (ANFTSMC) is proposed for underwater manipulator robotics with asymmetric actuator saturations and unknown time-varying (TV) external disturbances. Firstly, the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) control scheme is conducted for the underwater manipulator robotics, which guarantees the boundedness of all the signals in the control system. Secondly, the adaptive method and the smooth hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function are introduced to address the unknown TV external disturbances and the input saturation errors. Thus the prior knowledge about the upper bounds of the system uncertainties is not needed in this paper. To deal with the nonlinear asymmetric input saturation issue, a Gaussian error function is employed in the asymmetric saturation module so that the discontinuous input signals can be transformed into smooth forms. Thirdly, the rigorous mathematical verification is conducted to demonstrate the stability and finite-time convergence of the closed-loop control system via the Lyapunov theory.

abstract={To improve the performance of underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS), which is subject to system uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances in trajectory tracking control, a sliding mode controller is proposed in this paper. Firstly, in order to reduce a influence of system uncertainties and external disturbances, a sliding mode controller is designed based on an exponential approach law. Then the error asymptotic convergence of the trajectory tracking control is proven by the Lyapunov-like function. Finally, the effectiveness of the sliding mode controller is verified by rich simulation. Results show that the designed controller can not only realize the coordination control of UVMS accurately, but also can eliminate the chattering of control signal. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper presents the detailed modeling and simulation of the dynamic coupling between an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a manipulator. The modeling processes are described with the incorporation of the most dominating hydrodynamic effects such as added mass, lift and drag forces. The hydrodynamic coefficients are derived using strip theory and are adjusted according to dynamical similarity. A fuzzy decoupling controller (FDC) is proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) which consists of two subsystems, an underwater vehicle and a manipulator. The proposed controller uses a fuzzy algorithm (FA) to adaptively tune the gain matrix of the error function (EF). The EF is described by the integral sliding surface function. This technique allows the off-diagonal elements developed for decoupling the system to be incorporated in the gain matrix. Tracing the FA and EF back to the principle of feedback linearization, one further obtains evidence about the decoupling and stability of the system. Moreover, a desired trajectory with the consideration of the dynamic coupling of the AUV is designed to reduce the thruster forces and manipulator's torques. This technique provides high performance in terms of tracking error norms and expended energy norms. A major contribution of this study is that it adopts the off-diagonal elements to exploit the dynamic coupling between the degrees of freedom of the subsystem and the dynamic coupling between the two subsystems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new trajectory tracking scheme for the constrained nonlinear underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). For overcoming the unmodeled uncertainties, external disturbances, and constraints of control inputs in the operation of UVMS, a modified constrained H∞ controller with a basic computed-torque controller (CTC) and a new designed nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) are proposed. The CTC gives the nominal model-based control. The NDO is designed based on the system dynamics and used to online provide the estimation of the lumped disturbances. However, the designed NDO is an observer of biased estimation, i.e., it has a blind domain of disturbance estimation which cannot be rejected. In order to reject the biased estimation, the modified constrained H∞ controller is designed but with new features. To the best of our knowledge, the conventional H∞ robust controller is generally designed by calculating the Riccati equation offline and ignoring the constraints of control inputs made by the physical actuators, which are poor in handling the time-varying environment. In order to solve these issues, the modified constrained H∞ robust controller online optimized by grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is designed to ensure the control system has a compensation of the biased estimation, a satisfied constrained control input, and a fast calculation. In this paper, we modify the prior method of offline calculating the Riccati equation of the conventional H∞ robust controller to be an online optimization scheme and proposed a new constrained evaluation function. The new constrained evaluation function is online optimized by the GWO, which can both find out the constrained suboptimal control actions and compensate the biased estimation of the NDO for the UVMS. The whole system stability is proved. The effectiveness of the fast online calculation, tracking accuracy, and lumped disturbances rejection is shown by a series of UVMS simulations. © 2020 Yong Dai et al.},

abstract={A fundamental network design problem is that of designing “efficient” routes for moving products, resources and information through a network. Usually the route must satisfy a variety of constraints. The efficiency of a network can be measured in terms of cost, reliability, throughput or length of path used. The constraints of a network can consist of delivery/pickup time deadlines, network availability, the need to visit specific nodes of the network, or resource restrictions such as vehicle capacity, fleet size or transmission rates to name a few. We consider a class of path design problems which arise when an object needs to traverse between two points through a specified region, the Transit Path Problem being one such problem. The Transit Path Problem is to determine an optimal path, in terms of minimizing risk or cost or maximizing reliability, for an object, such as a robot or vehicle, that needs to traverse a specified region between two points. This problem arises in many areas of real life. For example, the routing of military vehicles through a detection field or the routing of a new highway in a given terrain. Other applications include motion planning for robot manipulators through a field of obstacles and the generation of optimal trajectories for air, space, naval and land vehicles. We specifically look at the problem of determining an optimal transit path for a submarine moving through a field of sonar sensors, subject to a total time constraint. The strategy presented involves a two stage approach. The first stage is a discretization of the problem and the development of a network heuristic method, based upon a parameterisation using a convex combination, to solve the resulting network. The second stage involves the use of an optimal control model, the application of the CPET technique, and a solution procedure that utilizes the solution obtained in the first stage as a starting point. In the proposed model each of the sensors can detect the presence of the submarine with a probability which is a given function depending on the distance between the two and on the speed of the submarine. This function is not a simple analytical expression, but depends upon a range of factors, including the characteristics of the ocean floor and ocean surface, depths of the sensor and the submarine, and the temperature and salinity of the water. In this paper, we use probability of detection functions reported in (Hallam 1997). These were constructed under the assumptions that the geographic location and environmental conditions are known and that the submarine remains at a constant depth. Furthermore, each of the given functions is constructed for a particular constant vessel speed. While there are still further factors influencing the probability of detection (such as machinery states, frequency of the sensor, alertness of sensor operators or quality of the automatic detection, the relative aspect of the submarine and the sensor, the effect of sudden changes in travel direction or speed), the functions from (Hallam 1997) contain sufficient detail to test the feasibility of the proposed method. The overall probability of detection at any point in time can then be calculated as an appropriate combination of these individual probabilities of detection. Here, we make the assumption that the probability of detection for any one sensor is independent of the probabilities of detection for the other sensors. The objective then is to find a transit path between two fixed positions in the sensor field which will minimize the overall probability of detection while still satisfying a maximum travel time constraint. The difficulty is due to the fact that the transit time must satisfy an upper bound constraint. Computational results support the use of our methodology. They show the heuristic we use to be both efficient and satisfactory. The heuristic generates a good quality initial solution for the discretized network problem. This starting path is then refined by means of an optimal control approach. In this phase of our procedure we make use of the optimal control software package MISER3. Improvements can be made in the range of 9 to 34% by employing the optimal control approach. © MODSIM 2005 - International Congress on Modelling and Simulation: Advances and Applications for Management and Decision Making, Proceedings.

abstract={This paper presents an uncalibrated visual servoing scheme for underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs) with an eye-in-hand camera under uncertainties. These uncertainties contain vision sensor parameters, UVMS kinematics and feature position information. At first, a linear separation approach is addressed to collect these uncertainties into vectors, and this approach can also be utilized in other free-floating based manipulator systems. Secondly, a novel nonlinear adaptive controller is proposed to achieve image error convergence by estimating these vectors, the gradient projection method is utilized to optimize the restoring moments. Thirdly, a high order disturbance observer is addressed to deal with time-varying disturbances, and the convergence of the image errors is proved under the Lyapunov theory. Finally, in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical simulations based on a 9 degrees of freedom (DOFs) UVMS with an eye-in-hand camera are conducted. In simulations, the UVMS is expected to track a circle trajectory on the image plane, meanwhile, time-varying disturbances are exerted on the system. The proposed scheme can achieve accurate and smooth tracking results during simulations. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper presents a control scheme for addressing the moving target grabbing problem by a kinematically constrained redundant underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) in the presence of unmodeled uncertainties, sensory detecting noises, and time-varying external disturbances. Our proposed control scheme is designed by a robust fast tube model predictive controller (FTMPC) with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) target observer. The proposed robust FTMPC consists of an online fast nominal MPC and an online ancillary nonlinear controller to overcome the uncertainties and disturbances of the UVMS. The problem of the UVMS kinematic redundancy and mechanical/physical constraints is translated into a part of online optimization of FTMPC. The feasibility and stability of the FTMPC are proved. The proposed EKF observer is used to estimate the moving target trajectory and overcome the sensory measurement (system) noises, which can eliminate the assumption that most prior existing research works need to know the tracking reference trajectory precisely. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified through a series of UWSim simulations by the 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) vehicle and 5-DoF manipulator GIRONA500 UVMS. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Aiming at the problem that the control performance of the manipulator is easily affected in the complex underwater working environment, but the traditional control method is not effective, an intelligent controller based on the fuzzy RBF (radial basis function) neural network method is proposed to control the underwater manipulator precisely and stably. In the water disturbance environment, the manipulator was usually affected by the additional mass, water resistance and buoyancy. The Lagrange method and Morison equation were used to establish a dynamics model of the two-bar manipulator, which included those hydrodynamic terms mentioned above. By using the fuzzy RBF neural network, the hydrodynamics uncertainties in the dynamics equation of the underwater manipulator were identified overall and fitted. With the advantages of heuristic search of fuzzy system and high reasoning speed of RBF neural network, the control performance of underwater manipulator system had better precision and strong adaptability. Considering the hydrodynamic terms, the stability of the underwater manipulator system was proved by using Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the simulation experiment of trajectory tracking control for a two-bar manipulator was carried out by using MATLAB, and the control effect of fuzzy RBF neural network, conventional RBF neural network identification method and traditional fuzzy control method was compared. The simulation results showed that compared with the conventional RBF neural network identification method, under the control of fuzzy RBF neural network, the response time and relative error of joint 1 of the two-bar manipulator was reduced by 91% and 88%, the response time and relative error of joint 2 was reduced by 92% and 77%; compared with the traditional fuzzy control method, the relative error of joint 1 and joint 2 was reduced by 65% and 10%. The research results show that the control effect of fuzzy RBF neural network is better than that of conventional RBF neural network identification method and traditional fuzzy control, which can provides a high precision and effective control method for the underwater manipulator control. © 2019 Zhejiang University Press.},

abstract={The article deals with the technology of constructing a 3-D velocity field mathematical model for flow around manipulators of anthropomorphic robots, such as the SAR-400 robot, when subjected to wave and constant currents. The studies show that when building control systems for manipulators operating underwater, it is necessary to take into account the arising forces acting on the manipulators as external disturbances that impede the precise fulfillment of control tasks. Methods for calculating 3-D velocity fields under the influence of wave and constant currents on the structural elements of manipulators of an underwater anthropomorphic robot as cylinders of large and small elongations are considered. A numerical simulation of the evolution of the flow velocity and pressure fields in a flow past a cylinder has been performed. The proposed approaches will allow the simulation of external disturbances acting on the manipulators of the robot working under water when constructing their control laws. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This article presents a centroid variability model–based controller of HITUWV (Underwater Welding Vehicle by Harbin Institute of Technology), an underwater welding vehicle, for automatic welding with high stability and accuracy. First, an accurate centroid variability model, which considers the coefficient changes of the HITUWV caused by the movements of a 3-degree-of-freedom manipulator, is presented to perform the dynamic characteristics of the HITUWV precisely. Second, a centroid variability model–based adaptive sliding model controller is developed for the HITUWV to complete centroid variability compensation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed centroid variability model–based adaptive sliding model controller demonstrates better performances in stability and accuracy than the conventional proportional–integral–derivative controller and the model-based proportional–integral–derivative controller. As a result, the centroid variability model–based adaptive sliding model controller holds great practicality and utility on the control of underwater operation with high stability and accuracy. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Summary This paper presents a hybrid strategy-based coordinate controller with a novel nonlinear disturbance observer for autonomous underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs). This method can reduce the influence from external unknown disturbances, inner coupling effects and model uncertainties by using a modified disturbance observer. Considering the natural redundancy property of the UVMS, the redundancy resolution algorithm is often utilized to give desired trajectories in the vehicle-joint space. However, because of the calibration errors, assembling errors and numerical errors, these desired trajectories may not lead the end-effector to the goal point accurately. To realize accurate motion control even when small errors exist in the planning phase, a hybrid strategy is introduced to transform the controller in the joint-vehicle space to the controller in the task space. Numerical simulations based on a UVMS have been carried out to testify the effectiveness of the proposed coordinate controller and the hybrid strategy. During the simulations, unknown disturbances are exerted upon the system. The trajectory tracking and error fixing performances are discussed in comparative analyses. The controller also maintains robust characteristics in comparison with the passivity-based controller and the proposed controller but without the disturbance observer. Experiments are also carried out to test its performance. © Cambridge University Press 2019.},

abstract={This paper presents an adaptive neural disturbance observer based nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) control method for underwater robot manipulators in the presence of external disturbances. Radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are used in the disturbance observer to approximate the unknown external disturbances, which can improve the robustness of the control system. Moreover, an improved reaching law is applied in the NFTSM strategy to quicken the response of input signals in the different control period. Afterward, it can be demonstrated that all the state signals are ultimately bounded via the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, numerical simulation results are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a method of dynamic modeling and a modified sliding mode control algorithm applied on multi-link underwater manipulators. Firstly, combining Lagrange equation with Morison formula, we establish the dynamic model of a 3 DOF underwater manipulator in hydrostatic environment. Water resistance, additional mass force and buoyancy are calculated to discuss the influences to all joints working in underwater environment. Next, we presented an improved sliding mode control strategy for the accurate trajectory tracking control of underwater manipulator. To address the issue of chattering problem for sliding mode control and unavailable normalization factor, an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode is proposed. In order to validate the effectiveness of the presented controller, two simulations are conducted. The results are compared with other control algorithm and show that no matter in convergence rate or control accuracy, the proposed controller has better control effect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A double closed-loop integral sliding mode UVMS(Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System) controller that can effectively overcome the uncertainty of dynamic parameters and current disturbance and significantly improve sliding mode chattering is designed. In actual marine operations, due to the complex underwater environment, it is difficult for UVMS to establish an accurate dynamic model and there are time-varying current disturbances outside it, which makes it difficult to control the motion of UVMS. Aiming at these problems, a double closed-loop integral sliding mode controller which is easy to apply in engineering and has good dynamic performance is designed. This controller can reduce the sliding mode chatter by designing the integral sliding surface instead of the traditional sliding surface and using the continuous hyperbolic tangent function instead of the discontinuous switching function. Moreover, it is not sensitive to hydrodynamic parameter changes and current disturbances and has strong robustness. Furthermore, the double closed-loop sliding mode structure makes the controller have faster convengence speed and better stability. At the same time, it does not need to identify parameters online, so it is also easy to implement physically. Finally, The simulation experiments of the UVMS are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the controller. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={A fractional integral sliding mode control scheme was proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problems of underwater manipulators with unknown and bounded external disturbances. The proposed method was made with the adoption of the exponential reaching law that was based on a fractional integral sliding mode surface and with one term added as the approximate estimate for the external disturbances, which made it possible to achieve fast convergence and have strong capacity of resisting disturbances for the systems. Moreover, the stability of the closed-loop system could be guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations of the six degree-of-freedom (DOF) underwater manipulators shows promising results that validate the high-precision tracking performance and the better robustness of the proposed control systems against external disturbances. © 2019, China Mechanical Engineering Magazine Office.

abstract={This paper presents an algorithmic solution for depth control. Depth control for Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) is essential to complete a specific underwater manipulation. A large number of algorithms have been designed to tackle the depth control problem. However, because of water currents, algorithm for depth control is required strong robustness. This work describes an adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) method to implement the depth control. The designed SMC method combining the proposed adaptive algorithm can alleviate influence of uncertain parameters of system and external disturbances. The stability is proven by a Lyapunov function. Then, we build a ROS-based underwater simulation environment-UWSim. Real-time depth and velocity of UVMS can be obtained by depth gauge and IMU via ROS nodes. Finally, we conduct a depth control simulation with our proposed hybrid-driven underwater vehicle-manipulator system (HD-UVMS). A comparative simulation is also implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract={The articulated intervention AUV (AIAUV) is an underwater swimming manipulator (USM) with intervention capabilities. Station-keeping and trajectory tracking are essential for the AIAUV to be able to move in confined spaces and to perform intervention tasks. In this paper we propose using the generalized super twisting algorithm, which is an extension of the regular super-twisting algorithm, for the trajectory tracking of the joint angles, position and orientation of the base of the AIAUV in 6DOF. Furthermore, we show the ultimate boundedness of the tracking errors. We also demonstrate the applicability of the proposed control law and compare the performance with the regular super-twisting algorithm with adaptive gains. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract={This paper proposes an improved Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach including a fuzzy compensator in order to track desired trajectories of autonomous Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems (UVMS). The tracking performance can be affected by robot dynamical model uncertainties and applied external disturbances. Nevertheless, the MPC as a known proficient nonlinear control approach should be improved by the uncertainty estimator and disturbance compensator particularly in high nonlinear circumstances such as underwater environment in which operation of the UVMS is extremely impressed by added nonlinear terms to its model. In this research, a new methodology is proposed to promote robustness virtue of MPC that is done by designing a fuzzy compensator based on the uncertainty and disturbance estimation in order to reduce or even omit undesired effects of these perturbations. The proposed control design is compared with conventional MPC control approach to confirm the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of robustness against uncertainties, guaranteed stability and precision. © 2019 Hossein Nejatbakhsh Esfahani, published by Sciendo 2019.},

abstract={This paper presents a unified motion planning approach for an Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) in a cluttered environment with localization uncertainty. With the uncertainty being propagated by an information filter, a trajectory optimization problem closed by a Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian controller is formulated for a coupled design of optimal trajectory, localization, and control. Due to the presence of obstacles or complexity of the cluttered environment, a set of feasible initial I-AUV trajectories covering multiple homotopy classes are required by optimization solvers. Parameterized through polynomials, the initial base trajectories are from solving quasi-quadratic optimization problems that are linearly constrained by waypoints from RRTconnect, while the initial trajectories of the manipulator are generated by a null space saturation controller. Simulations on an I-AUV with a 3 DOF manipulator in cluttered underwater environments demonstrated that initial trajectories are generated efficiently and that optimal and collision-free I-AUV trajectories with low state uncertainty are obtained. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVM-S) plays a vital role in ocean exploration. However, the system's parametric uncertainty and external disturbance increase the difficulty in designing an appropiate controller. In this paper, the term including parametric uncertainty and external disturbance is estimated using uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE). Then, the term is incorporated into a sliding mode control (SMC) method to compensate the uncertainties in hydrodynamic parameters of the vehicle and reject the external disturbance. The proposed UDE-SMC control scheme do not include the switching functin of SMC, which descreases the chattering effect of SMC. In addition, due to the system's kinematic redundancy, the inverse kinematic method based on pseudo-inverse of Jacobian matric is presented to investigate redundancy resolution. The main contribution of this paper is that it presents a simple model-based trajectory tracking controller for UVMS. Finally, the numerical simulations along with the comparative study are conducted. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a receding horizon (RH) motion planner is developed for an underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS) consisting of an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and a robotic arm with multiple joints. The desired task is assigned as driving the end effector to a predefined pose while keeping roll and pitch of the UUV in a small range. Model-based constraints such as input saturations and mechanical limits are explicitly considered within the RH framework, and thus the generated velocities are executable for the real system. Compared with the task priority control approach, which has been widely studied for motion planning of UVMSs, the RH planner is better in its optimality and capability to deal with complicated environments and mission requirements. Performance of these two approaches is compared in simulation studies and effectiveness of the proposed RH motion planner is verified. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={An underwater swimming manipulator (USM) is a long and slender underwater vehicle composed of multiple links that are connected by motorized joints and equipped with thrusters. The USM belongs to the class of underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMS), and the main task is to carry out autonomous inspections and light intervention operations on subsea installations. To achieve this, it is important to develop a control system that maintains the stability of the USM, while at the same time utilizes the kinematic redundancy of this highly flexible underwater vehicle. In this paper, we propose a combined kinematic and dynamic control approach for the USM. The approach uses the singularity robust multiple task priority (SRMTP) framework to generate a velocity reference and combines this with a dynamic velocity controller based on sliding mode control (SMC). This novel approach allows us to analyze the stability properties of the kinematic and dynamic subsystems together, in the presence of model uncertainty, while still retaining the possibility to solve multiple tasks simultaneously. We show that the multiple set-point regulation tasks will converge asymptotically to zero without the strict requirement that the velocities are perfectly controlled. This novel approach then avoids the assumption of perfect dynamic control that is common in kinematic stability analyses for robot manipulators. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach through a simulation study of a USM carrying out three simultaneous tasks. The results show that all the regulation tasks converge to their respective set-points. The proposed control approach is applicable to vehicle-manipulator systems in general, and for any combination of regulation tasks. © 2019. The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Recently, Intervention-Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUVs), started to grab researchers attention. While prior systems rely on variations of the task-priority redundancy control framework, our recent research demonstrated experimental results using search-based motion planning for a single arm floating-based intervention in known and unknown environments. In this work, we present a search-based motion planning algorithm applied to the coordinated manipulation problem of a dual-arm Intervention AUV, in an object transportation mission (e.g. pipe transportation). Two Challenges are considered: the high-dimensionality of the system, and the motion coordination between the mobile base and both working arms. The latter challenge is a major one if accurate execution is required, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV. Our approach relies on exploiting the loose coupling between the different system components. We show for the first time the use of a search-based planner on a dual-arm underwater manipulator. In addition, we support our claims with a simulated demonstration, successfully performing a coordinated dual-arm underwater intervention. © 2019. The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Existing belief space motion planning methods are not efficient for underwater robots that are subject to spatially varying motion and sensing uncertainties arising from the non-uniform current disturbances and landmark populations, respectively. Based on a closed-loop stochastic control framework, we propose a fast Gaussian belief space planning approach for coupled optimization of trajectory, localization and control, resulting in a non-linear programming problem (NLP). In particular, as opposed to advancing the covariance by a Kalman filter in the existing literature, we utilize an upper bound of the trace propagation of the covariance, thereby avoiding to solve Riccati equations and thus, reducing the computational complexity. The NLP is then efficiently solved by sequential quadratic programming based on the initial solutions obtained from RRT-connect. These initials lie in multiple homotopy classes guaranteed by H-signature discrimination, leading to global optimality with probability one as the number of samples in RRT-connect goes to infinity. Numerical simulations on holonomic and non-holonomic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and an Intervention-AUV with a manipulator in cluttered underwater environments demonstrate that optimal and collision-free trajectories with low localization uncertainty are obtained efficiently. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a centralized control system is designed for the two HAUVs undertaking underwater transportation of a spherical payload via cylindrical manipulators. First, the nonlinear coupled dynamic model is developed considering the rigid body connection method for transportation. The effect of the hydrodynamic, hydrostatic and thrust parameters are taken about the centre of the combined body i.e. the centre of payload. Path trajectory is generated using the minimum snap trajectory algorithm. The trajectory is divided into segments for each directional motion which is further divided into the waypoints based on the time step of the duration. The path between two waypoints is represented by a 7th order polynomial. The centralized control system is designed to follow the desired trajectory. The control system is designed using PID controllers for the motion control in each direction. The main technical requirements are the stability of the payload, accurate trajectory tracking and robustness to overcome uncertainties. Stability cannot be compromised because of the rigid connection between the vehicles and the payload, whereas, tracking is given a tolerance of ±5%. Transportation task is observed for the desired motion in the horizontal plane. The time domain motion simulation results show that the desired trajectory has been accurately followed by the combined system while meeting the technical requirements. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The underwater swimming manipulator (USM) is a snake-like, multi-articulated, underwater robot that is equipped with thrusters. One of the main purposes of the USM is to act like an underwater floating base manipulator. As such, it is essential to achieve good station-keeping and trajectory tracking performance for the USM by using the thrusters and by using the joints to attain the desired position and orientation of the head and tail of the USM. In this ‘paper, we propose a sliding mode control (SMC) law, specifically the super-twisting algorithm with adaptive gains, for the trajectory tracking of the USM's centre of mass. A higher-order sliding mode observer is proposed for state estimation. Furthermore, we show the ultimate boundedness of the tracking errors. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed control law and show that it leads to better performance than a linear PD-controller. © 2018 Chinese Automatic Control Society and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

abstract={This paper proposes a motion planning method that reduces the thrust of underwater robots moving a manipulator. The proposed method plans motion with 12-degree-of-freedom (12-DOF) for underwater robot, including 6-DOF for Body and 6-DOF for the manipulator. 2-DOF are used for the body’s orientation, roll and pitch and 3-DOF for manipulator position and orientation each. While the robot performs a task, if the thrust of the underwater robot is close to the limit of thruster, the underwater robot reduces its thrust by moving the center of the mass (COM) of the manipulator using null-space control without disturbing the task. The proposed method has been verified via simulation, by planning motion such that the thrust of the underwater robot is reduced under the limit of thrusters. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle or I-AUV has recently started to grab researchers attention in the last 20 years. Only three I-AUVs have demonstrated autonomous manipulation skills: ALIVE, SAUVIM and GIRONA 500. While prior systems rely on variations of the task-priority redundancy control framework, our recent research showed preliminary results using motion planning for floating-based intervention in the presence of obstacles. With the increasing need for autonomously performing more complex manipulation tasks, two main challenges need to be addressed: the high-dimensionality of the system, and the motion coordination between the mobile base and the working arm. The latter challenge is of high importance if accurate execution is required, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV and the control challenges that come with it. Our approach relies on exploiting the loose coupling between the AUV and the arm. In particular we present an approach based on MR-MHA ∗ (Multi-Representation, Multi-Heuristic A∗), and we show how it can generate efficient trajectories by exploiting decoupling. We show for the first time the use of a search-based planner on a high-dimensional underwater manipulator. In addition, we support our claims with experimental analysis of the generated trajectories with respect to various metrics in different environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to conduct a full intervention mission in a realistic simulated underwater intervention environment. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Underwater hydraulic manipulator with the advantages of heavy load and mature technology, is widely used in ROV and HOV, however, the autonomous operating ability of ROV or HOV’s manipulator is relatively weak. To solve this problem, in this paper, an underwater autonomous dual manipulator platform is developed which would be utilized in key technology research on underwater IMR (Inspection, Maintenance and Repair), ocean exploration and other marine applications to alleviate the operating burden and improve working efficiency. Using the same manipulator configuration as the 6000m Scientific ROV of SIA, the platform is comprised of two underwater hydraulic manipulators and has a three-axis motion base of the manipulators. Additionally, the control system is based on the ROS (Robot Operating System) and MoveIt!. This paper tends to illustrate some fundamental research of the platform, such as the system overview of the platform, modeling, motion planning in Matlab and ROS, and the computer-based control of single manipulator. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Underwater vehicles are being emphasized as highly integrated and intelligent devices for a significant number of oceanic operations. However, their precise operation is usually hindered by disturbances from a tether or manipulator because their propellers are unable to realize a stable suspension. A dynamic multi-body model-based adaptive controller was designed to allow the controller of the vehicle to observe and compensate for disturbances from a tether or manipulator. Disturbances, including those from a tether or manipulator, are deduced for the observation of the controller. An analysis of a tether disturbance covers the conditions of the surface, the underwater area, and the vehicle end point. Interactions between the vehicle and manipulator are mainly composed of coupling forces and restoring moments. To verify the robustness of the controller, path-following experiments on a streamlined autonomous underwater vehicle experiencing various disturbances were conducted in Song Hua Lake in China. Furthermore, path-following experiments for a tethered open frame remote operated vehicle were verified for accurate cruising with a controller and an observer, and vehicle and manipulator coordinate motion control during the simulation and experiments verified the effectiveness of the controller and observer for underwater operation. This study provides instructions for the control of an underwater vehicle experiencing disturbances from a tether or manipulator. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={A double-loop fractional integral sliding mode control (DLFISMC) strategy is designed to solve the trajectory tracking problem of an underwater manipulator with bounded external disturbance, which is composed of the outer loop position control and the inner loop velocity one. On the basis of the fractional theory and the stability method, the sliding mode surfaces and the reaching laws are designed respectively. In addition, an auxiliary is introduced to the inner loop controller to estimate the external disturbance. The Lyapunov theory can ensure the finite-time convergence and stability of the closed-loop system. The simulation results from a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) underwater manipulator validate the higher precision tracking performance and better robustness of the proposed control system against the external disturbance. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last years, the development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) with attached robotic manipulators, the so-called Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System (UVMS), has gained significant research attention, due to the ability of interaction with underwater environments. In such applications, force/torque controllers which guarantee that the end-effector of the UVMS applies desired forces/torques towards the environment, should be designed in a way that state and input constraints are taken into consideration. Furthermore, due to their complicated structure, unmodeled dynamics as well as external disturbances may arise. Motivated by this, we proposed a robust Model Predicted Control Methodology (NMPC) methodology which can handle the aforementioned constraints in an efficient way and it guarantees that the end-effector is exerting the desired forces/torques towards the environment. Simulation results verify the validity of the proposed framework. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={To ensure satisfactory control performance for the underwater vehicle-manipulator systems, a novel continuous nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller is proposed and investigated using time delay estimation in this article. Complex lumped unknown dynamics including the strong nonlinear couplings and external disturbance are properly compensated with time delay estimation, which are mainly based on the time-delayed signals of underwater vehicle-manipulator systems and can provide with a fascinating model-free feature. Afterwards, the satisfactory tracking control performance and good robustness under heavy lumped uncertainties are ensured using the continuous nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode term with a fast terminal sliding mode–type reaching law. Therefore, the proposed controller is easy to use thanks to time delay estimation, and can ensure good control performance owing to continuous nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode. Stability of the closed-loop control system is analyzed using Lyapunov stability theory, and theoretical tracking errors are calculated and presented. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed controller are demonstrated through comparative 7-degree-of-freedom pool experiments. © IMechE 2017.},

abstract={For the multi-degrees of freedom control problem of underwater hydraulic manipulators with non-ignorable valve deadband and strong lumped nonlinearities and uncertainties, a practical continuous fractional-order nonsingular terminal sliding mode control design together with a deadband compensator is presented and studied. The presented method contains three parts a time delay estimation utilized to nearly estimate and compensate the extremely complicated system dynamics, a continuous fractional-order nonsingular terminal sliding mode used to ensure high control performance against the strong lumped nonlinearities and uncertainties, and a valve deadband compensator used to compensate for the non-ignorable valve deadband. The proposed method is model-free thanks to the time delay estimation, and can ensure satisfactory control performance thanks to the continuous fractional-order nonsingular terminal sliding mode and deadband compensator. Stability of the closed-loop control system including the deadband compensator is proved rigorously. Finally, practical 2-degrees of freedom experiments are performed, and corresponding results effectively demonstrate the superiorities of the newly presented controller with deadband compensator. © IMechE 2018.},

abstract={As marine resources development and marine science research increasingly improve, manipulators are mounted on the unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to fulfil a series of complex underwater operation tasks. The control of underwater vehicle manipulator system(UVMS) is difficult to directly realize for high-dimensional kinematical and dynamical resolving, cumulative error effect and aggravated modelling uncertainty; Position and attitude control of the end effector is essential for accurate accomplishment of typical tasks, which depends greatly on whether the UUV could stably maintain a desired position and attitude. Concentrating on the dynamic positioning of UUV in the presence of disturbances caused by working manipulators, a fuzzy switching sliding mode control method is adopted and enhanced by a dynamic normalization factor. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and engineering realizability of the proposcd approach. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel bilateral adaptive control scheme to achieve position and force coordination performance of underwater manipulator teleoperation system under model uncertainty and external disturbance. A new nonlinear model reference adaptive impedance controller with bound-gain-forgetting (BGF) composite adaptive law is designed for the master manipulator force tracking of the slave manipulator. The reference position in task space is obtained from the linear second-order impedance model whose input is the force error of the master and the slave. The adaptive terminal sliding mode control based on adaptive uncertainty compensation is proposed to achieve the master position tracking of the reference position. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) local approximation method is proposed for the slave manipulator's position tracking. The RBFNN based on Ge-Lee (GL) matrix is adopted to directly approximate each element of the slave manipulator dynamic, and the robust term with a proper update law is designed to suppress the error between the estimate model and the real model, and the external disturbance. The asymptotic tracking performance and global stability of the teleoperation system are proved with Lyapunov stability theorem. The simulation and experiment verify the performance of the proposed controller in teleoperation manipulator model. The results show that the teleoperation system has a good ability of position and force coordination. © 2018},

abstract={Sampling-based, search-based, and optimization-based motion planners are just some of the different approaches developed for motion planning problems. Given the wide variety of application tackled by autonomous mobile manipulators, the question “which planner to choose” may be tough. In this paper, we review the state of the art of the most common approaches, and present a set of benchmarks with the aim to provide not only a theoretical review but also a qualitative/quantitative comparison of the algorithms. Our purpose is to provide an insight and analyze their performance with respect to different metrics. The results are based on an Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System UVMS, although they can be extended to terrestrial and aerial robots as well. The paper uses these results to formalize a set of guidelines for the selection process of the most appropriate approach, for a given problem/requirements. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper describes the state-of-the art in the area of underwater robot manipulator systems. A brief introduction is given on the use of manipulators in various offshore industries for different subsea intervention applications. It provides a comprehensive summary of existing commercial and prototype underwater manipulators, covering relevant aspects such as design features, their capabilities and merits, and provides a detailed comparison. This is followed by a thorough analysis of advantages and disadvantages of both electrically and hydraulically actuated manipulators. Furthermore, a detailed description of commercially available underwater manipulator control systems is presented in order to provide a realistic picture of the existing technology and its limitation. In addition, an extensive bibliography covering research results in the field of control algorithms is presented, including low level motion control, high level kinematic control and motion planning schemes along with the implementation issues. © 2018 University of Limerick},

abstract={An adaptive bilateral control strategy is proposed for the uncertainty of the mathematical model and external disturbances during the teleoperation of underwater manipulator. A reference adaptive impedance control law based on the nominal model is designed for the uncertainty of the parameters of the master manipulator model and the external disturbance. The reference position of the expected model is adjusted by the deviation between the force of operator and the slave manipulator, and the model uncertainty is compensated by the adaptive control law. Aimed at the uncertainty of slave manipulator, the adaptive compensation is achieved by the radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and the approximation deviation is eliminated by the design of the sliding mode variable structure controller and the robust adaptive controller, which satisfies the position tracking of the slave manipulator to the master manipulator. The tracking performance and global stability are proved by Lyapunov function, and the asymptotic convergence of force-position tracking is guaranteed. The results show that the overall controller has good force-position tracking ability under the conditions of model uncertainty and external disturbance. The whole system is stable and feasible, and has robustness and adaptive control ability. © 2018, Editorial Board of JBUAA. All right reserved.},

abstract={UVMS consisting of the underwater vehicle and underwater manipulator is a dynamically coupled system. The movement of the underwater manipulator has a great impact on the stability of the underwater vehicle. A control scheme combining robust feedback control of the vehicle and feed forward compensation of the manipulator is proposed. First, the dynamic modelling of UVMS by Newton-Euler method is presented and used to obtain compensation. And then, we designed a sliding mode controller with the compensation. Finally, computer physics simulations are performed to investigate the effectiveness of this scheme in stability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, a robust finite time trajectory tracking control approach is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which belongs to the class of highly nonlinear, coupled dynamics with motion in 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The finite-time error convergence and robust control task is accomplished by designing a non-singular fast fuzzy terminal sliding mode controller (NFFTSMC) with disturbance estimator for the 6-DOF dynamics of an AUV. The proposed NFFTSMC incorporates a non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC) which not only assures faster and finite convergence of the tracking errors to the equilibrium from anywhere in the phase portrait but also eliminates the issue of singularity dilemma appeared in conventional terminal sliding mode controller (TSMC); a fuzzy logic control (FLC) tool is employed to generate the hitting control signal in order to reduce chattering in control inputs, which commonly occur in conventional TSMC, and an estimated uncertainty term to compensate for the un-modeled dynamics, external disturbances, and time-varying parameters. Furthermore to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it has been extended to task space control problem of an AUV - manipulator system (AUVMS) employed for underwater manipulation tasks. Simulation studies confirms the potency of the proposed method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This letter presents a new method to address the problem of task-constrained motion planning for aerial manipulators. We propose a control-aware planner based on the paradigm of tight coupling between planning and control. Such paradigm is especially useful in aerial manipulation, where the separation between planning and control is not advisable. The proposed sampling based motion planner uses a controller composed of a second-order inverse kinematics algorithm and a dynamic tracker, as a local planner, thus allowing a more natural consideration of the closed-loop system dynamics. For task-constrained motions, this method let us to sample directly in the reduced and more relevant task space, predict the behavior of the controller avoiding motions that bring to singularities or large tracking errors, and guarantee the correct execution of the maneuver. The method is tested in simulation for a multidirectional-thrust vehicle endowed with a 2-DoF manipulator. The proposed approach is very general, and could be applied to ground and underwater robotic systems to perform manipulation or inspection tasks. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper addresses the achievement of floating autonomous manipulation of the underwater biomimetic vehicle-manipulator system (UBVMS). A practical vehicle-manipulator coordinated plan and control methodology of the UBVMS for autonomous interventions are designed. First, the system configuration is introduced, and the optimal work space is confirmed. Then, the control framework of the UBVMS mainly consisting of online motion planning, multitask kinematic control, dynamic feedforward compensation, and adaptive parameter undulatory control for autonomous manipulation is presented. The online motion planning method with resort to tracking differentiator is developed to produce desired task trajectory and reference rate. The singularity-robust multitask kinematic control algorithm with state observers is designed to obtain system reference velocity. The couple influence on the vehicle induced by the presence of the manipulator is described as the dynamic feedforward compensation signal to reduce undesired waggle of the UBVMS. Adaptive parameter modifier of the biomimetic propulsor is designed to satisfy multifarious performance requirements in different motion phases. Finally, pool experiments in multiple scenarios for autonomous grasping manipulation are conducted to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the developed coordinated plan and control strategy. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A novel nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) method based on time delay estimation (TDE) was proposed in order to solve the trajectory tracking control problem of underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) under the unknown complex lumped disturbance. TDE was used as the baisc framework and the strong roubustness of NTSMC was combined to realize the high performance trajectory tracking control under complex lunmped disturbance. The method can ensure good control performance, strong robustness and easiness for practical applications benefiting from the attractive model-free feature of TDE and the strong robustness of NTSMC. Comparative 9 degree of freedoms (DOFs) numerical simulations and 7 DOFs pool experimental studies were conducted using a UVMS developed in our laboratory. Results show that the method can ensure better comprehensive control performance compared with the traditional TDE-based control method using the same control gains under the unknown complex lumped disturbance. The former system can ensure a precision of 0.038 m for the end effector of the UVMS while the latter one can obtain a precision of 0.067 m. © 2018, Zhejiang University Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={The trajectory tracking control problem of operational AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) is addressed. In general, the stretching and operation processes of underwater manipulator will lead to changes of AUV dynamic performance, which will affect the AUV trajectory tracking control, and so does the water current. Aiming at the trajectory tracking control problem of AUV, an adaptive terminal sliding mode control method based on RBF (radial basis function) neural network is proposed. Under the framework of Lyapunov stability theory, the RBF neural network is used to approximate the changes of AUV dynamic performance caused by the stretching of the manipulator and the disturbance of the water current online. Then combined with the adaptive terminal sliding mode controller, the weights of neural network and control parameters of AUV are adaptively adjusted online. According to the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the system trajectory tracking error of AUV is uniformly stable and bounded. Aiming at the chattering problem caused by the sliding mode control items, a chattering reduction method for the saturated continuous function with variable sliding mode gain is proposed to reduce the chattering of sliding mode control variables. Experiments on heading and vertical trajectory tracking are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the AUV system control method and the sliding mode chattering reduction method. © 2018, Science Press.

abstract={For solving the trajectory tracking problem of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system (UVMS) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances, this paper presents an indirect adaptive control scheme which consists of three parts: an extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimation compensative system, a model-based computed torque controller (CTC), a H∞ robust compensative tracking controller. The contribution of our method is that it can overcome the disadvantages of existing control schemes, which are based on the accurate dynamic model of UVMS, known statistics unmodeled dynamics/external disturbances (e.g., constant or Gaussian), or the accurate, efficient system feedback measurement states by the sensors. According to the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is shown that the proposed indirect adaptive control scheme can guarantee its embedded H∞ robust controller tracking performance for our UVMS. Simulations show that the proposed control scheme can satisfy the design requirements of UVMS in rapid convergence, tracking accuracy, system stability and disturbance attenuation.

abstract={In underwater robotic interaction tasks (e.g., sampling of sea organisms, underwater welding, panel handling, etc) various issues regarding the uncertainties and complexity of the robot dynamic model, the external disturbances (e.g., sea currents), the steady state performance as well as the overshooting/undershooting of the interaction force error, should be addressed during the control design. Motivated by the aforementioned considerations, this paper presents a force/position tracking control protocol for an Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System (UVMS) in compliant contact with a planar surface, without incorporating any knowledge of the UVMS dynamic model, the exogenous disturbances or the contact stiffness model. Moreover, the proposed control framework guarantees: (i) certain predefined minimum speed of response, maximum steady state error as well as overshoot/undershoot concerning the force/position tracking errors, (ii) contact maintenance and (iii) bounded closed loop signals. Additionally, the achieved transient and steady state performance is solely determined by certain designer-specified performance functions/parameters and is fully decoupled from the control gain selection and the initial conditions. Finally, both simulation and experimental studies clarify the proposed method and verify its efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The articulated intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (AIAUV) is a slender, multi-articulated, underwater robot that is equipped with thrusters, i.e. an underwater swimming manipulator (USM). For the AIAUV to be able to move in confined spaces and perform intervention tasks, it is essential to achieve good station-keeping and trajectory tracking performance for the AIAUV by using the thrusters and by using the joints to attain the desired position and orientation of the vehicle. In this paper, we propose a sliding mode control (SMC) law, specifically the super-twisting algorithm with adaptive gains, for the trajectory tracking of the joints angles and position and orientation of the base of the AIAUV, and we consider this tracking problem of the AIAUV in 6 DOF. A higher-order sliding mode observer is proposed for state estimation. Furthermore, we show the ultimate boundedness of the tracking errors, and we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed control law with simulations. © 2018},

abstract={In this paper, the dynamic model of rigid-flexible coupling system for an underwater manipulator based on element coupling deformation is established, in which three reference frames (global frame, floating frame, and element translate frame) are used to describe the configuration of the point in flexible body. A robust sliding mode control is presented for the position control and tracking control of the manipulator. The simulations are performed and the results show that the presented controller has good performance to track some moving underwater object or approach some fixed target point.

abstract={Last decade has seen a spurt in autonomous technologies in military and civilian sectors. The search for oil and gas is moving into ever deeper waters, and the need for coastal surveillance and climatic monitoring, makes underwater autonomous assistance quite obvious for a developing nation like India with thousands of kilometres of coastline. Using such platforms in these endeavours provides an efficient way to keep human life out of harm’s way in hostile environments. The prototype developed has its navigation based on an internal IMU (Inertial Mass Unit) and the software is extensible to support DVL (Doppler Velocity Logger) based navigation. Near range object detection and path planning is achieved via Image Processing and using two surge and one heave thrusters the bot can operate in three degrees of freedom. The modular structure allows for the addition of extra sensors like pressure, temperature and manipulators like grippers and torpedoes. It has a Intel Atom processor, which runs the control algorithms for motion and required task completion.},

abstract={Most inspection and repair works are performed with robots in a nuclear power plant, as a human operator cannot access the facility due to radiation. In order to ensure the integrity of the reactor vessel, the reactor nozzle welds should be inspected periodically. The inspections have been performed using a conventional inspection machine with a large sturdy column; however, these machines are so large and heavy that their handling and maintenance requires much effort. In order to resolve these kinds of problems, the authors have developed a mobile robotic manipulator, which is very small and light and easy to handle. The underwater mobile robot with magnetic wheels is guided by a laser beam for its accurate positioning. Even though the inspection system is light and simple, its accurate positioning for reactor nozzle weld inspection is much more difficult and complex. This article explains how to position our laser-guided mobile robot manipulator at the reactor vessel wall and determines the pan and tilt angle of the laser pan-tilt device to guide the robot along a specified path around the nozzle. We derive the path planning of the mobile robotic manipulator when inspecting nozzle welds on the upper shell of the vessel, and we experimented the whole robotic system to identify position accuracy of the robot movements through the inspection scanning of reactor nozzle. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={To ensure high-performance tracking control of cable-driven manipulators under complex uncertainties, we propose a novel optimal nonsingular terminal sliding mode (ONTSM) control scheme using super-twisting algorithm (STA) and time-delay estimation (TDE) technique. The TDE technique is applied as framework to take advantage of its model-free nature. Meanwhile, by introducing a quadratic performance index, we design an ONTSM manifold to achieve high dynamical performance in the sliding mode phase. Afterward, the modified STA is utilized to provide good performance in the reaching phase. Thanks to above three elements, the proposed ONTSM control with STA and TDE schemes is model-free and easy to apply in complicated practical applications. The stability of the closed-loop control system is analyzed considering the ONTSM and STA dynamics. Finally, comparative experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiorities of our newly proposed control scheme over two existing control schemes. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={A novel underwater long-arm manipulator (ULAM) and its improved small-flow hydraulic driving system (SHDS) are presented in this article for small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In the process of manipulator design, a joint driving device consisting of linear hydraulic cylinder, three-bar linkage, and four-bar linkage mechanism is developed to allow the manipulator to be folded. Since the manipulator is much long, a small joint angle deviation would result in a large end-effector’s position deviation. To solve the problem, a small-flow hydraulic driving device with circulation in closed loop is proposed. And in the long-arm manipulator, the cross-sectional area of manipulator is small. So the diameter of hydraulic pipeline installed inside the manipulator is limited, but the pipeline should also be long enough. In this case, it is common to cause large pressure loss in hydraulic system. And, rather than oil, water is selected as the hydraulic medium due to the low viscosity. In the hydraulic system design, a scheme with circulation in closed loop and improved sealing structure (consisting of O-ring and Glyd-ring) are developed to reduce the internal leakage and maintain a good end-effector’s precision. In addition, the compressibility of water is relatively large, and it would bring bad impact on end-effector’s precision. In this case, the vacuum-treated water is used and it has a good performance in the high-pressure condition. But in the low-pressure condition, the problem is still serious. In order to solve the problem, based on the “vacuum treatment,” a pre-pressurization pressure treatment is added for the vacuum-treated water. All the improved ways are verified by experiment results. Finally, the end-effector’s positioning experiment and trajectory tracking experiment are conducted on manipulator and small AUV, so as to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the ULAM. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Concentrating on the dynamic positioning of unmanned underwater vehicle in the presence of disturbances caused by working manipulators, a fuzzy switching sliding mode control method is adopted and enhanced by a dynamic normalization factor. Firstly, sliding mode control is used as the principal algorithm to guarantee the robustness and disturbance rejection ability. Secondly, a fuzzy inference engine is exploited to adjust the switching gains of the controller online, so that the switching gains are reduced and the control signals are smoothened without losing the robustness and the disturbance rejection ability. Finally, a dynamic normalization factor is introduced to normalize the input of the fuzzy inference engine to achieve a trade-off between sensitivity and stability. Simulation cases were performed along with comparisons with proportion–integration–differentiation controller and constant switching sliding mode controller. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and engineering realizability of the proposed approach.},

abstract={Underwater autonomous manipulation is a challenging task, which not only includes a complicated multibody dynamic and hydrodynamic process, but also involves the limited observation environment. This study systematically investigates the dynamic modeling and control of the underwater vehicle-manipulator multibody system. The dynamic model of underwater vehicle-manipulator system has been established on the basis of the Newton–Euler recursive algorithm. On the basis of dynamic analysis, a motion planning optimization algorithm has been designed in order to realize the coordinate motions between AUV and manipulator through reducing the restoring forces and saving the electric power. On the other hand, a disturbance force observer including the coupling and restoring forces has been designed. An observer-based dynamic control scheme has been established in combination with kinematic and dynamic controller. Furthermore., from the simulations, although the disturbance forces such as restoring and coupling forces are time varying and great, the observer-based dynamic coordinate controller can maintain the AUV attitude stable during the manipulator swing and pitch motions. During the precise manipulation simulation, the stable AUV attitude and minimization of disturbance forces have been realized through combination of optimal motion planning and the observer-based dynamic coordinate controller. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={For the motion coordination problem between the underwater vehicle and manipulator of the underwater vehicle-manipulator system, a new redundancy resolution method is proposed and investigated. The proposed method mainly has two parts: a fuzzy logic part and a multitasks weighted gradient projection method part. The fuzzy logic part is used to decide the weight factors of the motion distribute matrix and the priorities of all the secondary objectives, while the multitasks weighted gradient projection method part is used to handle the secondary objectives with the weight factors and priorities decided by the fuzzy logic part. Moreover, a new secondary objective is proposed to optimize underwater vehicle-manipulator system’s attitude, which takes the payload into consideration. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed redundancy resolution is verified through some comparative simulations. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={To solve the trajectory tracking control problem of underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) under strong nonlinear couplings and complex parametric uncertainties and unknown external disturbance, a nonlinear robust control method based on time delay estimation (TDE) was proposed and investigated in this paper. The core idea of this method is that builds the basic architecture of the controller with TDE, and realizes the online estimation and real time compensation of the complex unknown lumped dynamics for the system. Afterwards, a designed desired dynamic equation is used to regulate the system control performance. Benefitting from the compensation of the unknown lumped dynamics and the model-free nature of TDE, the proposed method has good robustness and practical easy usage. Finally, the effective of the proposed method was demonstrated by comparative numerical simulations with a 9 degree of freedoms (DOFs) UVMS. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Given the importance of underwater manipulator in the process of grasping and carrying the object, the simple 4-joint underwater manipulator is designed. Considering the factors of water flow, the hydrodynamic model is established by using the Morision formula. Through the numerical calculation method, the effects of the buoyancy, water resistance and added mass force on the dynamics of the underwater manipulator are analyzed. On this basis, the controllers of the conventional sliding mode algorithm and the double loop integral sliding mode algorithm are established. The simulation results of trajectory tracking show that: the double loop integral sliding mode algorithm has better performances in response speed, stability and adaptability compared with conventional sliding mode control algorithm. This paper provides valuable references for the dynamic study and motion control of underwater manipulator. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In various interaction tasks using Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems (UVMSs) (e.g. sampling of the sea organisms, underwater welding), important factors such as: i) uncertainties and complexity of UVMS dynamic model ii) external disturbances (e.g. sea currents and waves) iii) imperfection and noises of measuring sensors iv) steady state performance as well as v) inferior overshoot of interaction force error, should be addressed during the force control design. Motivated by the above factors, this paper presents a model-free control protocol for force controlling of an Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System which is in contact with an unknown compliant environment, without incorporating any knowledge of the UVMS's dynamic model, exogenous disturbances and sensor's noise model. Moreover, the transient and steady state response as well as reduction of overshooting force error are solely determined by certain designer-specified performance functions and are fully decoupled by the UVMS's dynamic model, the control gain selection, as well as the initial conditions. Finally, a simulation study clarifies the proposed method and verifies its efficiency. © 2017},

abstract={is paper addresses a task-space trajectory control of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) employed for interactive underwater tasks. .e robust task-space tracking control is achieved by designing a non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC) with disturbance estimator and demonstrated on a planar underwater vehicle with serial two link manipulator arm a.ached to it. .e proposed NFTSMC integrates a non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC) with a non-linear disturbance observer. This combination not only assures €nite and faster convergence of the systems states to the equilibrium from anywhere in the phase-plane but also overcomes the problem of singularity associated with conventional terminal sliding mode controller (TSMC). In addition to this, because of the disturbance observer augmented in the proposed control law, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is enhanced to a great extent. .e feasibility of the proposed NFTSMC is con€rmed by performing extensive numerical simulation on the UVMS for tracking a given pre-de€ned task space trajectory under the in.uence of parameter uncertainties, ocean current and measurement sensor noises.},

abstract={SUMMARY As various robots are anticipated to coexist with humans in the near future, safe manipulation in unknown, cluttered environments becomes an important issue. Manipulation in an unknown environment, however, has been proven to be NP-Hard and the risk of unexpected human - robot collision hampers the dawning of the era of human - robot coexistence. We propose a non-contact-based sensitive skin as a means to provide safe manipulation hardware and interleaving planning between the workspace and the configuration space as software to solve manipulation problems in unknown, crowded environments. Novelty of the paper resides in demonstration of real time and yet complete path planning in an uncertain and crowded environment. To that end, we introduce the framework of the sensor-based interleaving planner (SBIP) whereby search completeness and safe manipulation are both guaranteed in cluttered environments. We study an interleaving mechanism between sensation in a workspace and execution in the corresponding configuration space for real-time planning in uncertain environments, thus the name interleaving planner implies. Applications of the proposed system include manipulators of a humanoid robot, surgical manipulators, and robotic manipulators working in hazardous and uncertain environments such as underwater, unexplored planets, and unstructured indoor spaces. © Cambridge University Press 2016.},

abstract={Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) is a useful system to perform diverse and sophisticated operations under the water. However it is difficult to control the motion of UVMS due to external disturbances such as payloads holding underwater objects, currents, etc. In this paper, in order to ensure the dynamic stability of the UVMS, redundancy resolution method is proposed using a zero moment point (ZMP) algorithm. In order to evaluate the proposed ZMP algorithm and redundancy resolution method, a testbed composed of redundant manipulator was developed. The results show that ZMP algorithm helps the stability of the UVMS while the end-effector of the manipulator tracks the desired trajectory accurately. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a practical design method for the robust control of a class of MIMO nonlinear plants operating under model uncertainties and matched disturbances where the only available information for feedback are the outputs of the plant. A neural networks based dynamic integral sliding mode control (NNDISMC) with output differentiator observer is developed for the considered class. This NNDISMC approach utilizes the robust output differentiation observer for the higher derivative estimation and neural networks to estimate the nonlinear functions which are assumed unknown. Having estimated the unknown derivatives and uncertain functions, an integral manifold based on the estimated states is designed and a control law is proposed which confirms the sliding mode enforcement across the designed integral manifold from the very start of the process. The overall robustness of the controller is guaranteed by using the neural networks, differentiator observer and dynamic integral control law in a closed loop. The closed loop stability analysis is presented in detail, and the asymptotic convergence of the system states to the equilibrium is confirmed. The proposed method is very practical and plays a very significant role in the robust control of electromechanical systems, such as robotic manipulators, unmanned air vehicles and underwater vehicles. The simulation results on a robotic manipulator are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper develops a virtual platform of an underwater manipulator mounted on a submersible vehicle via the three-dimensional simulator 'Webots' for teleoperation through a replica master arm. The graphical, kinematic, and dynamic models of the manipulator refer to a master-slave servo hydraulic manipulator with seven functions, consisting of six degrees of freedom and a parallel gripper, while the 'Jiaolong' deep-manned submersible vehicle, operating below the sea surface down to 7000 m, is chosen as the underwater manipulator carrier. This study uses the virtual platform for training an operator to telepresence control the virtual manipulator to complete basic tasks in subsea environments. When training the operator, one has to consider uncertain external disturbances and the visual impacts that stem from subsea environments. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual platform, one designs two typical underwater operational tasks: Grasping a marine organism sample and reaching at a given position. This paper presents the comparative studies: 1) the performances demonstrated by remotely controlling the virtual manipulator and the real manipulator; 2) the operating performances delivered by three operators before and after training when using the platform. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a robust single-input fuzzy logic control Robust Single Input Fuzzy Logic Controller (RSIFLC) scheme is proposed and applied for task-space trajectory control of an autonomous underwater vehicle manipulator system (AUVMS) employed for underwater manipulation tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is numerically demonstrated on a planar underwater vehicle manipulator system [consisting of an underwater vehicle and a two link rotary (2R) serial planar manipulator]. The actuator and sensor dynamics of the system are also incorporated in the dynamical model of an AUVMS. The proposed control law consists of a feedforward term to exaggerate the control activity with immoderation from the known desired acceleration vector and an estimated perturbed term to compensate for the unknown effects namely external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics as a first part and a single-input fuzzy logic control as a feedback portion to enhance the overall closed-loop stability of the system as a second part. The primary objective of the proposed control scheme is to track the given end-effector task space trajectory despite of external disturbances, system uncertainties, and internal noises associated with the AUVMS. To show the efficacy of the proposed control scheme, comparison is made with conventional fuzzy logic control (CFLC), sliding mode control (SMC), and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. Simulation results confirmed that with the proposed control scheme, the AUVMS can successfully track the given desired spatial trajectory and gives better and robust control performance. © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents, a robust nonlinear proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-like fuzzy control scheme for a task-space trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (AUVMS) employed for deep-sea intervention tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is numerically demonstrated on a planar underwater vehicle manipulator system (consisting of an underwater vehicle and two link rotary (2R) serial planar manipulator). The actuator and sensor dynamics of the system are also incorporated in the dynamical model of an AUVMS. The proposed control law consists of two main parts: first part uses a feed forward term to reinforce the control activity with extravagance from known desired acceleration vector and carries an estimated perturbed term to compensate for the unknown effects namely external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics and the second part uses a PID-like fuzzy logic control as a feedback portion to enhance the overall closed-loop stability of the system. The primary objective of the proposed control scheme is to track the given end-effector task-space trajectory despite of external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises associated with the AUVMS system. To show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, comparison is made with linear and nonlinear PID controllers. Simulation results confirmed that with the proposed control scheme, the AUVMS can successfully track the given desired spatial trajectory and gives better and robust control performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A new nonlinear robust control scheme is proposed and investigated for the trajectory tracking control problem of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) using the discrete time delay estimation (DTDE) technique. The proposed control scheme mainly has two parts: The DTDE part and the desired dynamics part. The former one is applied to properly estimate and compensate the complex unknown lumped dynamics of the system, using the intentionally time-delayed system's information. The latter one is used to obtain the desired dynamic characteristic of the closed-loop control system. Thanks to the DTDE technique, the proposed control scheme no longer requires the detailed system dynamic information or the acceleration signals, bringing in good feasibility for actual applications and satisfactory control performance. The stability of the closed-loop control system is analyzed and proved using the bounded input bounded out stability theory. Finally, nine degree of freedoms (DOFs) simulation and seven DOFs pool experiment studies were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme with an UVMS developed in our laboratory. Corresponding results show that our proposed control scheme can ensure satisfactory control performance with relative small control gains and obtain a precision of 0.064 m for the end effector in the task space. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={It is extremely difficult to operate an underwater manipulator carried on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the deep sea. In order to investigate underwater manipulator operations maneuvered by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), this paper develops a virtual underwater manipulator and its carrier, the ROV, via the three-dimensional simulator “Webots” to animate operational tasks. The ROV model refers to the structure of a typical ROV which operates below the ocean's surface down to 1000 m, while the graphical and kinematic models of the manipulator refer to a master-slave servo hydraulic manipulator with 7 functions, consisting of six degrees of freedom (DOFs) and a parallel gripper for manipulations. This study uses the virtual platform to challenge an operator to conduct different tasks by using the manipulator, including two switch-based and one master arm-based operation, and combined by remote and autonomous operations. When conducting the operations, we have considered uncertain external disturbances that stem from subsea environments. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual platform, we have designed two typical underwater operational tasks for training the operator: grasping a machine part in a basket, and making a circle at a specified position on the seabed. The tasks are completed by coordinating the underwater manipulator, the submersible vehicle, and a pan-tilt camera. Three operators were invited for the training operations, and their operating results are presented. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents a control design method with a new nonlinear disturbance observer using delayed estimates for motion control of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). In recent years, application of an underwater vehicle has been expected in various fields. Since modeling unknown hydrodynamic forces is difficult, nonlinear disturbance observers have been proposed in the aim of decreasing disturbances due to hydrodynamic forces. In this paper, we propose a new disturbance observer by combining a conventional disturbance observer and time delay control, and attempt to apply it to motion control of a UVMS. Further, an analysis of ultimate boundedness and numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed control system. The respective analysis and simulation results show that the proposed disturbance observer exhibits faster convergence and less estimation errors than the conventional one and hence the control system based on it can perform successful motion control. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to control the position of an underactuated underwater vehicle manipulator system (U- UVMS). It is possible to control the end-effector using a regular 6-DOF manipulator despite the undesired displacements of the underactuated vehicle within a certain range. However, in this study an 8-DOF redundant manipulator is used in order to increase the positioning accuracy of the end-effector. The redundancy is resolved according to the criterion of minimal vehicle and joint motions. The underactuated underwater vehicle redundant manipulator system is modeled including the hydrodynamic forces for the manipulator in addition to those for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The shadowing effects of the bodies on each other are also taken into account when computing the hydrodynamic forces. The Newton-Euler formulation is used to derive the system equations of motion including the thruster dynamics. In order to establish the end effector trajectory tracking control of the system, an inverse dynamics control law is formulated. The effectiveness of the control law even in the presence of parameter uncertainties and disturbing ocean currents is illustrated by simulations. © 2016 Chinese Automatic Control Society and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

abstract={Underwater vehicles are usually designed with additional degrees of freedom than those required to accomplish given manipulator tasks. A robot platform should be effective to maintain its position and orientation in order to attain diverse underwater tasks. This study addresses the dynamic modeling of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) which consists of tilting thrusters for hovering motion to oppose reaction force of the manipulator and ocean current. The suggested system consists of four tilting thrusters with six degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The tilting movements of the thrusters make the system unstable due to complex coupling. A robust position tracking controller is designed based on redundancy resolution scheme has been posited. The trajectory tracking potentiality of the manipulator has been analyzed. The numerical results of the proposed redundancy resolution scheme indicate that this approach shows a significantly revamped outcome when compared with the conventional counterpart. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) is basically a redundant system. Hence, this redundant system can have various combinations of joint velocities that do not affect the given velocity profile of an end-effector and this may induce a self-motion of a vehicle. In the current paper, the performance index based on the concept of Zero Moment Point(ZMP) is proposed to enhance the stability of the redundant UVMS while the specified task is performed by using the underwater manipulator. In order to generate the joint angle trajectories of the manipulator, a redundancy resolution is performed to minimize the distance between the position of ZMP and the mass center of the underwater vehicle, which means the propulsion energy for controlling the vehicle's motion can be reduced. To control the motion of the system with uncertainties, a controller based on the sliding mode theory has been designed. Finally, an example simulation of a simple UVMS is conducted to show the performance of the designed robust controller. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a complex approach for solving the problem of fast and high qualitative performing of underwater manipulative operations in underwater vehicle hovering mode. The amended recursive algorithm for solving of inverse problem of a multilink underwater manipulator dynamic was developed in this work. Presented algorithm provides precision calculating of undesirable influences on the underwater vehicle from manipulator, moving at high speed. The values of these influences are proportional to the viscous friction coefficients of the each manipulator link. For defining these coefficients and also its dependence on the tilt angle of link to the fluid flow, the experimental approach is proposed. The vehicle invariance to manipulator influences is provided by thrusts of the vehicle screws with help of the open-loop stabilization system. But even at unintended displacements of the vehicle from initial position, the proposed method of automatic correction of underwater multilink manipulator configuration allows to provide desired accuracy of manipulator trajectory tracking. This correction is based on information about real vehicle shifts from desired position and provides additional movements of the multilink manipulator. Mathematical simulation had confirmed high efficiency of described control systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Hydraulic system is widely used in industry where large actuation forces are needed such as electro-hydraulic positioning system, active suspension control, and so on. One of the main problem in hydraulic system is the nontriviality, for instance, the deadbands in valve operation, frictions of links, saturations, pressure dynamics, etc. both system unknown nonlinearities and external disturbances should be considered in controller design. For underwater hydraulic manipulator, because of the environment of sea and the large nonlinearities of the hydraulic manipulator system, both system unknown nonlinearities and external disturbances should be considered in controller design. A lot of control methods have been proposed to solve the problem properly, such as sliding mode control, adaptive control, fuzzy adaptive control, adaptive robust control, ect. However, due to limited knowledge about hydraulic manipulator system, it is hard to precisely estimate the nonlinearities for a possible higher performance. In this paper, a neural network adaptive robust control method is proposed to help control an underwater hydraulic manipulator. In order to achieve better performance using adaptive robust control strategy, unknown nonlinearities in the system are approximated by the outputs of radial basis function neural network (RBFNNs). A projection law has been used to bound the NN weights when they are tuning on-line to avoid possible adaptive divergence, and the tracking transient performance is guaranteed by robust control law. Simulation results illustrate that manipulator has a good tracking performance. © 2015 MTS.},

abstract={The operation of autonomous underwater vehicles is often hindered by their battery capacity, limiting the duration of its use. Here, we propose an integrated solution for autonomous charging of a robotic fish via direct contact through a novel claw mechanism for docking guidance. To assist the robotic fish in the docking process, the system incorporates a charging station designed with form-fit claws. A controller is designed to monitor the battery level of the robotic fish during free swimming and coordinate the docking process with respect to the maneuvers of both the robot and form-fit claws. Upon recognizing a low battery level, the controller commands the robotic fish to begin the docking process, and video feedback from an overhead camera is used to inform the autonomous navigation toward the charging station. After reaching a battery level threshold, the robotic fish is then released back in the water and returns to free swimming until the battery is discharged again. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the possibility of prolonged operation, consisting of repeated cycles of autonomous charging. Our proposed charging method enables prolonged autonomous swimming with minimal human supervision, opening the door for new, transformative applications of robotic fish in laboratory research and field deployment.

abstract={The paper addresses control of variable mass and configuration mechanical systems subjected to holonomic or nonholonomic constraints, which are imposed due to systems desired performance, tracking specified motions or other control needs. The control design is model-based and an analytical dynamics modeling framework underlying controller design is presented. The framework novelty is that constraints, including nonholonomic ones and these on variable mass, can be merged into variable mass system dynamics and final motion equations are free of the constraint reaction forces so they can be used directly to control design. Many mechanical systems change their mass or configuration when they move, e.g. inertia-based propelled underwater vehicles, mobile robots and manipulators transporting loads or space vehicles flying their space missions. The dynamics modeling framework presented in the paper can be applied to all variable mass system examples mentioned above. An underwater inertia-based propelled vehicle model dynamics and control performance illustrate the theoretical development presented in the paper. The paper contribution is two folded. It presents a unified approach to constrained variable mass or configuration systems modeling and introduces analytical dynamics methods to the nonlinear control domain. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.},

abstract={Research in animal behavior has benefited from the availability of robots able to elicit controllable, customizable, and versatile stimuli in behavioral studies. For example, biologically-inspired robotic fish can be designed to mimic the morphophysiology of predators and conspecifics to study fear response and sociality. However, size is a critical limitation of the existing arrays of robotic fish. Here, we present the design of a miniature robotic fish for future animal-robot interaction studies featuring a novel application of multi-material three-dimensional (3D) printing and utilizing a solenoid for actuation. The use of multi-material printing enables a skeletal design of only two parts, while retaining the complete functionality of larger prototypes enclosing requisite electronics and incorporating an active joint for propulsion. Parametric tests are conducted to test the swimming speed of the robotic fish and a compact dynamic model with two degrees of freedom to elucidate swimming of the robotic fish is presented.

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the two dimensional fluidstructure interaction problem of the oscillation of a shapemorphing plate in a quiescent, Newtonian, viscous fluid. The plate is considered as a moving wall for the fluid undergoing two concurrent periodic motions: a rigid oscillation along its transverse direction coupled to a shape-morphing deformation to an arc of a circle with prescribed maximum curvature. Differently from studies concerned with passive flexible structures, here, we introduce the prescribed deformation to specifically manipulate vortex-shedding and modulate hydrodynamic forces and energy losses during underwater oscillations. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed to evaluate the effect of the prescribed deformation strategy on the added mass and damping effect along with the hydrodynamic power dissipation. We observe that a minimum in the hydrodynamic power dissipation exists for an optimum curvature of the plate. This finding may allow significant power expenditure reduction in underwater vibrating systems where minimization of energy losses or maximization of quality factor are desirable.

abstract={This paper presents a robust nonlinear control scheme for task-space trajectory control for an autonomous underwater vehicle- manipulator system (AUVMS) based on an improved proportional integral derivative (PID) control scheme used for deep-sea intervention tasks. A planar underwater vehicle manipulator system (consists of an underwater vehicle and two link rotary (2R) serial planar manipulator) with dynamic coupling between them is considered for the study and numerical simulation. The actuator and sensor dynamics of the system are also considered. The proposed controller integrates the known approximated inverse dynamic model output as a model-base portion of the controller; uses a feed forward term to enhance the control activity with indulgence from known desired acceleration vector; carries an estimated perturbed term to compensate for the unknown effects namely external disturbances and un-modelled dynamics and a decoupled nonlinear PID controller as a feedback portion to enhance closed-loop stability and account for the estimation error of uncertainties. The primary objective of the proposed control scheme is to track the given end-effector task-space trajectory despite of external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises associated with the AUVMS system, which show the robustness of the proposed control scheme. Simulation results confirmed that the AUVMS can successfully track the given desired spatial trajectory. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Abstract An improved Time Delay Control (TDC) method for an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) is proposed. The proposed controller consists of three terms: a time-delay-estimation term that cancels nonlinearities of the UVMS dynamics, a Terminal Sliding Mode (TSM) term that provides a fast response and a PID term that reduces the tracking error. In addition the proposed controller uses fuzzy rules to adaptively tune the gains of TDC and PID terms. A full dynamic of UVMS is presented and some simulation studies are done. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. The proposed controller not only provides the high performance in trajectory tracking, but it also has an acceptable robustness in presence of the external disturbance and unknown forces/torques in comparison with conventional sliding mode controller. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={An Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) can be applied to pick up and carry objects for autonomous manipulation in the water. However, it is difficult to control the motion of the whole system because the movement of a manipulator affects the motion of the vehicle and vice versa. Additionally, a lack of information about the object, such as the shape and inertia, makes motion control even more difficult. In the current paper, a motion control algorithm of the UVMS with redundancy was developed to guarantee the stability robustness when the mass information of the objects is not available. In order to generate the joint trajectories of the manipulator, a redundancy resolution was performed to minimize the restoring moments acting on the vehicle. This means the propulsion energy for controlling the vehicle’s motion can be reduced. To control the motion of the system with an unknown parameter, a controller based on the sliding mode theory has been designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through a series of simulation for a 3DOF vehicle-3DOF manipulator system. © 2015, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper presents a coordinated motion control scheme using a disturbance observer in task space for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). Since, the UVMS is kinematically redundant in nature, the proposed controller permits self-motion which can be utilized to perform power efficient trajectory tracking and at the same time it also assures that the system is able to track the given desired spatial trajectory with minimal errors (despite the presence of external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises). The performance of the proposed coordinated motion control of the UVMS is demonstrated numerically by simulating a few underwater tasks such as payload conveyance. The system's disturbance compensation capabilities are shown and the effects of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties on the station keeping performance are also analyzed. A comparative analysis on power consumption is presented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The paper investigates a path planning and following algorithm of observing targets for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system(UVMS). The algorithm including the operational task assignment and path following for the UVMS is proposed. The operational task assignment consists of path planning and task assignment. Path planning provides planned trajectory distance between any two targets for task assignment, and task assignment produces a suitable task order for the minimum of the UVMS sailing distance. In path planning, the shortest path considering UVMS nonholonomic constraints - Dubins curve, is employed. It is implemented by matrix transformation. Then a digraph is generated by marking the shortest distance between any two targets. Hence the task assignment problem is considered as a traveling salesman problem, which can be achieved by the genetic algorithm. Finally a path-following guidance method is employed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, a novel local motion planning algorithm is presented, for underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS) that perform autonomous underwater inspection operations. An optimization problem is formulated considering the collision avoidance, the approximation of the given task curve and critical optimization criteria. The searching method is based on an evolutionary algorithm and it is able to generate a local motion plan using continuously updated sensor information. The working environment is represented by a Bump-surface entity, constantly updated by a parallel algorithm implemented on a graphical processing unit (GPU). A trained artificial neural network is used for the fast approximation of the considered dexterity index. The local planner can cope with unknown obstacles inside the workspace while executing the task and pursuing high performance configurations in the free space. A welding inspection on an underwater tube structure is considered as the validation scenario, while a UVMS with a mounted six degrees of freedom manipulator is assigned to perform the task. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={This study considered the hybrid position/force control of robots with an oscillatory base. The objective when controlling such a system is to control the contact force between the environment and the object in the constrained directions. The auxiliary control input laws with the ANFIS tuning methodology were successfully applied to robot manipulators mounted on an oscillatory base to provide hybrid position/force control. Linguistic fuzzy information from human knowledge was incorporated into the fuzzy system, which was equipped with a training algorithm. The advantage of the proposed control scheme is that only select control inputs are needed to select control inputs for task space trajectory tracking. In other words, such a system does not require the redesign of the vibration damping controller. Tracking performance comparison is also presented for the proposed control scheme and the other existing control techniques. It is shown that the proposed fuzzy control scheme offers several implementation advantages such as less steady-state errors, reduced effect of overshoot, and a fast convergent rate in real-time verification. The experimental results of this study confirmed the efficiency of the proposed control design and its feasibility for use in various mechanical systems, including mobile robots, gantry cranes, underwater robots, and other dynamic systems mounted on oscillatory bases and used to perform constrained motion tasks. © The Author(s) 2013.},
