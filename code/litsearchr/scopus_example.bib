abstract={In the literature of control theory, tracking control of port controlled Hamiltonian systems is generally achieved using canonical transformation. Closed form evaluation of state-feedback for the canonical transformation requires the solution of certain partial differential equations which becomes very difficult for nonlinear systems. This paper presents the application of neural networks for the canonical transformation of port controlled Hamiltonian systems. Instead of solving the partial differential equations, neural networks are used to approximate the closed-form state-feedback required for canonical transformation. Ultimate boundedness of the tracking and neural network weight errors is guaranteed. The proposed approach is structure preserving. The application of neural networks is direct and off-line processing of neural networks is not needed. Efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the examples of a mass-spring system, a two-link robot arm and an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). © 2020, ICROS, KIEE and Springer.},

abstract={In order to solve the influence of external disturbance of ocean current and uncertainty of system parameters on the control stability and tracking accuracy of underwater manipulator, an ADRC (Active Disturbance Rejection Control) control method based on terminal sliding mode is proposed. This method is insensitive to hydrodynamic parameter change and flow disturbance, and has strong robustness. It uses saturation function instead of sign function to make control signal more stable and control output more gentle. The reliability, stability and robustness of the proposed control method are verified by simulating the actual underwater situation and simulating the controller under different conditions, such as current environment and external disturbance environment. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This work is the second part of a survey devoted to disturbance observers that appeared in the theory and practice of automatic control back in the mid-1960s. The first part of the survey was devoted to theoretical results. This part of the survey is devoted to practical application of disturbance observers. We consider such applications as control of ships and underwater vehicles, control of aircraft and robotic manipulators, suppression of narrow-band vibrational oscillations, estimation and suppression of disturbances in electrical systems, control of cars and their component units, and a number of other applications. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

First, the AUVMS is separated into nine subsystems, and the combined effects of dynamic uncertainties, hydrodynamic force, unknown disturbances, and nonlinear coupling terms on each subsystem are lumped into a single total disturbance. Next, a linear extended state observer (LESO) is presented to estimate the total disturbance. Then, a sliding mode active disturbance rejection control (SMADRC) scheme is proposed to enhance the robustness of the control system. The stability of the SMADRC and the estimation errors of the LESO are analyzed. Because it is difficult to simultaneously adjust several parameters for a LESO-based SMADRC scheme, a fuzzy logic control (FLC) scheme is used to formulate the FSMADRC to determine the appropriate parameters adaptively for practical applications. Finally, two AUVMS tasks are illustrated to test the trajectory tracking performance of the closed-loop system and its ability to reject and attenuate the total disturbance. The simulation results show that the proposed FSMADRC scheme achieves better performance and consume less energy than conventional PID and FLC techniques. © 2020, Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={This article presents the design of a biomimetic underwater vehicle-manipulator system (BUVMS) with bioinspired long-fin propulsion and its control methods. The kinematic analysis of bioinspired long-fin propulsion is conducted, and the maximum thrust of this propulsion derived from our thrust measurement platform can be up to 25 N. Bioinspired long-fin propulsion is introduced to construct the BUVMS for inspection and manipulation tasks, and the system architecture of the BUVMS is described. Moreover, real-Time dynamic dubins-helix path planning and tracking of the biomimetic vehicle are proposed to realize the arrival of the desired pose. The tracking error is less than 0.23 body length. Finally, coordinated control between the biomimetic vehicle and the manipulator is developed to achieve autonomous manipulation. The reaction of the manipulator served as feedforward compensation is added into the closed-loop control of the biomimetic vehicle. The experimental results are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed methods. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A key challenge in autonomous mobile manipulation is the ability to determine, in real time, how to safely execute complex tasks when placed in unknown or changing world. Addressing this issue for Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUVs), operating in potentially unstructured environment is becoming essential. Our research focuses on using motion planning to increase the I-AUVs autonomy, and on addressing three major challenges: (a) producing consistent deterministic trajectories, (b) addressing the high dimensionality of the system and its impact on the real-time response, and (c) coordinating the motion between the floating vehicle and the arm. The latter challenge is of high importance to achieve the accuracy required for manipulation, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV and the control challenges that come with it. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate experimental results performing manipulation in unknown environment. The Multirepresentation, Multiheuristic A* (MR-MHA*) search-based planner, previously tested only in simulation and in a known a priori environment, is now extended to control Girona500 I-AUV performing a Valve-Turning intervention in a water tank. To this aim, the AUV was upgraded with an in-house-developed laser scanner to gather three-dimensional (3D) point clouds for building, in real time, an occupancy grid map (octomap) of the environment. The MR-MHA* motion planner used this octomap to plan, in real time, collision-free trajectories. To achieve the accuracy required to complete the task, a vision-based navigation method was employed. In addition, to reinforce the safety, accounting for the localization uncertainty, a cost function was introduced to keep minimum clearance in the planning. Moreover a visual-servoing method had to be implemented to complete the last step of the manipulation with the desired accuracy. Lastly, we further analyzed the approach performance from both loose-coupling and clearance perspectives. Our results show the success and efficiency of the approach to meet the desired behavior, as well as the ability to adapt to unknown environments. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, a design method of extended state observer (ESO)-based sliding mode control is proposed for underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs) with prescribed performance. First, the system model is reformulated by lumping the unknown uncertainties and disturbances into a total disturbance. Then, an ESO is developed to estimate the total disturbance. Based on ESO, the prescribed performance is defined to limit upper bounds of tracking error and then a sliding mode controller is proposed to ensure that all the signals are ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). Moreover, the tracking errors can converge to the neighborhood of zero in finite-time and satisfy the prescribed performances. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={A nonlinear robust control method for the trajectory tracking of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system that operates in the presence of external current disturbances is proposed using double closed-loop integral sliding mode control. The designed controller uses a double closed-loop control structure to track the desired trajectory in the joint space of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system, and its inner and outer loop systems use integral sliding surface to enhance the robustness of the whole system. Then, the continuous switching mode based on hyperbolic tangent function is used instead of the traditional discontinuous switching mode to reduce the chattering of the control input of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system. In addition, the control method proposed in this article does not need to estimate the uncertainties of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system control system through online identification, but also can ensure the robustness of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system motion control in underwater environment. Therefore, it is easier to be implemented on the embedded platform of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system and applied to the actual marine operation tasks. At last, the stability of the control system is proved by the Lyapunov theory, and its effectiveness and feasibility are verified by the simulation experiments in MATLAB software. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={This paper addresses the trajectory tracking problem for the constrained dynamical underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties, sensory measurement noises, and time-varying external disturbances. An adaptive robust fast computational optimal control scheme is presented for the large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) constrained dynamical UVMS. The structure of our proposed scheme is based on a fast incremental model predictive controller (MPC) embedded with an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The EKF estimation part is used to compensate the unmodeled uncertainties, sensory noises, and external disturbances. The fast MPC (FMPC) part is a trajectory-tracking controller designed by the terminal constrained MPC with an approximately fast computational cost function, which guarantees the optimal batch control process satisfying the state and input constraints. By resorting to a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FMPC is proved to be asymptotically stable with a monotonic decrease in the cost function, and can guarantee the tracking performance of the constrained dynamical UVMS. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified through a series of comparative simulations of a six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) vehicle-6DOF manipulator system. © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to avoid the vibration shock caused by the full extension of the manipulator of autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (AUVMS), a coordinated motion planning method based on virtual workspace constraints is proposed. A certain subset of the flexible workspace of the manipulator is selected as the virtual workspace in order to constraint the motion of the end effector. The soft joint limits is used to avoid self-interference, and the positional relationship between the end effector and the virtual workspace is determined by ray detection algorithm based on convex hull. The vehicle command velocity corresponding to the different self-movement states of AUVMS is deduced, so as to move the vehicle as little as possible. The results show that the proposed method not only solves the problem of the fully extended of the manipulator, but makes the tracking accuracy improved compared to the weighted minimum norm method. The position error is within ± 0.04 m, and the orientation error is within ± 3 °. © 2020 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

abstract={This paper presents new motion planning and robust coordinated control schemes for trajectory tracking of the underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) subjected to model uncertainties, time-varying external disturbances, payload and sensory noises. A redundancy resolution technique with a new secondary task and nonlinear function is proposed to generate trajectories for the vehicle and manipulator. In this way, the vehicle attitude and manipulator position are aligned in such a way that the interactive forces are reduced. To resist sensory measurement noises, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is utilized to estimate the UVMS states. Using these estimates, a tracking controller based on feedback Linearization with both the joint-space and task-space tracking errors is proposed. Moreover, the inertial delay control (IDC) is incorporated in the proposed control scheme to estimate the lumped uncertainties and disturbances. In addition, a fuzzy compensator based on these estimates via IDC is introduced for reducing the undesired effects of perturbations. Trajectory tracking tasks on a five-degrees-of-freedom (5-DOF) underwater vehicle equipped with a 3-DOF manipulator are numerically simulated. The comparative results demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller in terms of tracking errors, energy consumption and robustness against uncertainties and disturbances. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The dynamic model of the deep-sea electric manipulator is complex, so it is difficult to construct an accurate objective function of energy optimization based on dynamic model. Therefore, a method to establish power model of the manipulator is proposed, using radial basis function (RBF) neural network. Firstly, the RBF neural network is trained by using the experimental data set of underwater motion of the manipulator. By utilizing the power model based on the RBF neural network, the energy objective function of the manipulator is established combined with the trajectory planning polynomial of the manipulator joint space. Then, the adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve the optimal trajectory parameters. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of RBF power network is 20.89W, and the energy consumption based on the optimized trajectory is 410.8 J (18.3%) lower than the average energy consumption based on the the experimental trajectory. The experimental results show that the trajectory planning method based on the adaptive PSO algorithm achieves the goal of energy optimization. © 2020, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={In this paper we consider the problem of mixed H2/H∞ control to combine optimal and robust control for a double integrator system with nonlinear performance variables, and we apply this to control an articulated intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (AIAUV). The AIAUV has an articulated body like a snake robot, is equipped with thrusters, and can be used as a free-floating underwater manipulator. The objective is to control the joints of the AIAUV to desired setpoints without causing collisions between links or with obstacles in the environment. The mixed H2/H∞ problem is viewed as a differential game, and a set of matrix equations is solved in order to construct an approximate solution to the problem for a system described by double integrator dynamics and with nonlinear performance variables. A feedback linearising controller is derived to obtain the double integrator dynamics for the joints of the AIAUV, and the solution found for the mixed H2/H∞ control problem is applied to the resulting system. Simulations demonstrate that collisions between links of the manipulator are successfully avoided also in the presence of parameter uncertainties while regulating the joints to the desired setpoints, and the method can easily be extended to include collision avoidance with static and dynamic obstacles in the environment. © 2020 EUCA.},

abstract={Soft-robotic manipulators, with their closed-chamber elastomeric actuators, natural water-sealing and inherent compliance, are ideal for underwater applications for compact, lightweight, and dexterous manipulation tasks. However, their low structure rigidity makes soft robots highly prone to underwater disturbances, rendering traditional control methods unreliable, substantially increasing the challenges for high-dexterity control. To address this issue, we proposed an intuitive underwater hybrid manipulator system with a muscle-level mapping design concept. The manipulator was designed to construct an actuator-configuration which could directly map to the main muscles group in the human forearm. Exploiting this analogy, an electromyography-based wearable controller was developed using continuous bio-sensory data from the operator's arm to complement the intuitive manipulator control. A prototype of the proposed manipulator was constructed and validated in various experiments, where a human user could effectively use muscle activations to proportionally drive the soft-robotic manipulator in free-space motions, as well as performing object manipulation tasks both in air and underwater, only using visual feedback, with consistent performances under various time delays. The promising results of this work have demonstrated that the muscle-level analogy of soft robotics could lead to intuitive and effective underwater manipulation with simple structure and low control effort. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a novel approach for the control of underwater robots that can handle uncertainties and disturbance problems, which are commonly met in underwater environments. The considered system is an underwater manipulator with n-degrees of freedom. The approximation capability of an adaptive neural network is exploited to estimate uncertainties in system dynamics. Drag and lift forces are considered as an external disturbance, and a disturbance observer approach which has been proved to be effective with on-land robotic systems, is applied to compensate for it. The objective of the controller designed is to track a desired trajectory. To find the optimal gain parameters of this controller, a classical Genetic Algorithm is employed. Extensive simulation studies carried out on a two degrees of freedom manipulator indicate the efficacy of the proposed approach, proving that the disturbance observer originally developed for on-land systems can also be used effectively for underwater robotic systems. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller, tuned by the Genetic Algorithm is compared with that of a controller, tuned manually. The results show that the reliance on a well-known classic Genetic Algorithm for the tuning of the controller parameters not only saves time, but also provides better values of the parameters. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The joint control problem of the underwater manipulator is addressed in this paper, under the influence of uncertainty factors such as model uncertainty, external disturbance, and manipulator joint lag. In general, for the uncertainty factors, it is usually approximated online, but it is difficult to select a reasonable value for the approximation error boundary, too conservative estimated values would cause chattering problem easily. And the influence of joint lag on the manipulator control should be considered in actual work. Unlike most previous control method, in this paper, the function approximation technique (FAT), which uses the Legendre polynomial, is adopted to approximate the uncertainty factors online. Then, based on the proportion integral differential (PID) sliding manifold with the integral and differential of tracking error, a sliding model PID controller is designed to speed up the response and reduce the effects of joint lag. For the error boundary, the adaptive law is proposed, and it will reduce chattering of the control quantity under the steady state of the system. It was proved that the joint error of the control system is uniformly asymptotic convergence through the stability analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with pool comparison experiments of the underwater manipulator installed in the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper presents a new formulation of a reactive obstacle avoidance algorithm, in the Task-Priority framework, delivering a practical solution for obstacle avoidance between vehicle-manipulator systems and complex environments. The presented concepts were implemented on an intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (I-AUV) and tested in an underwater pipe structure inspection and valve turning scenario, in a test tank, using GIRONA500 with an ECA 5E Micro manipulator. The obstacle avoidance is treated as an inequality (set-based) task, which takes into account all obstacles that are interacting with the robot links. Both the robot and the obstacles are represented by spheres to allow for analytical formulation. However, the environment is wrapped with spheres based on its actual geometry stored as an Octomap, hence it can be represented at different resolutions. Depending on the type of the mission performed by the robot we defined two modes of operation: (1) Navigation and Inspection, and (2) Intervention. For each mode, the algorithm takes into account different number of key points at the I-AUV and a different resolution of the environment representation. Typically, for the Intervention mode the resolution is higher, to allow for more precise motion. We also present an escape point strategy in case of the robot getting stuck between obstacles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper, an adaptive nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control (ANFTSMC) is proposed for underwater manipulator robotics with asymmetric actuator saturations and unknown time-varying (TV) external disturbances. Firstly, the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) control scheme is conducted for the underwater manipulator robotics, which guarantees the boundedness of all the signals in the control system. Secondly, the adaptive method and the smooth hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function are introduced to address the unknown TV external disturbances and the input saturation errors. Thus the prior knowledge about the upper bounds of the system uncertainties is not needed in this paper. To deal with the nonlinear asymmetric input saturation issue, a Gaussian error function is employed in the asymmetric saturation module so that the discontinuous input signals can be transformed into smooth forms. Thirdly, the rigorous mathematical verification is conducted to demonstrate the stability and finite-time convergence of the closed-loop control system via the Lyapunov theory. Finally, numerical simulations are performed on a two-link underwater manipulator robotic system to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. © 2020, South China University of Technology, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Aiming at the requirements of lightweight, low energy consumption and low inertia of the manipulators for autonomous underwater vehicles, this article presents a novel underwater cable-driven manipulator for autonomous underwater vehicles. Thanks to the cable-driven mechanism, the motors are installed remotely from joints, which can reduce the disturbance of the motion of the manipulator to the system and extend the operation time under the premise of limited energy. Cable–sheath mechanism is used to realize the motors to be fixedly mounted on the base (postposition). A prototype named Polaris-II is assembled, and experiments are carried out with the time-delay control scheme. Although the control effect of a single time-delay controller is good, there exist large errors caused by the reversing of joints. Therefore, a fuzzy compensator is designed and added to the time-delay controller to suppress the large errors. The experimental results show that the time-delay controller with a fuzzy compensator has a good inhibitory effect on the large errors while maintaining good control effect. © IMechE 2019.},

abstract={With the deepening of ocean development, the tasks that underwater vehicles need to perform are more complex. Shared control provides a reliable scheme for robots to accomplish these tasks under teleoperation. At present, most of the underwater vehicles are equipped with traditional mechanical manipulator, which is challenging to realize the application of shared control. So, we developed a highly humanoid underwater robot for shared control. The robot is equipped with two humanoid arms. It can be remotely controlled by the operator through the full ocean depth optical fiber, and can also realize simple task planning based on its control system. We have realized and improved the auxiliary function in the operation room, such as motion capture, data fusion, etc. We built detailed modelling and simulation analysis of the robot, and used the sliding mode controller to achieve the stability control of the robot. Its reliability has been verified in the simulation and experiment. Finally, the robot completed the task autonomously in the offline state and showed a better control effect and stronger task completion ability under the shared control. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The worldwide demands for high protein seafood are growing rapidly. Through robots instead of divers completing the capture will not only reduce the cost, but also improve the operation safety. Although a great number of underwater vehicles have been developed, it is still difficult for them to realize agile and uninjured sea organism capturing autonomously. This paper is proposed to investigate the current state of art about underwater autonomous and dexterous operation robot, underwater autonomous environmental perception, underwater vehicle-manipulator system modeling and coordinated control, target uninjured grasp; in order to analyze the difficulties and research methodologies for the robot development of sea organism autonomous and uninjured capture. To make analysis on the organism autonomous capture process, this article has presented two different open frame underwater vehicles, the absorption type one and the grasp type one. Analysis including autonomous visual search and detection process, acceleration-level task priority redundancy resolution approach for trajectory planning and grasp capture. Experiments with the organism autonomous grasp and absorption process have both been purposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To improve the performance of underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS), which is subject to system uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances in trajectory tracking control, a sliding mode controller is proposed in this paper. Firstly, in order to reduce a influence of system uncertainties and external disturbances, a sliding mode controller is designed based on an exponential approach law. Then the error asymptotic convergence of the trajectory tracking control is proven by the Lyapunov-like function. Finally, the effectiveness of the sliding mode controller is verified by rich simulation. Results show that the designed controller can not only realize the coordination control of UVMS accurately, but also can eliminate the chattering of control signal. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System (UVMS) is an essential equipment for underwater operations. However, it is difficult to control due to the constrained problems of weak illumination, multidisturbance, and large inertia in the underwater environment. After the UVMS mathematical modelbased on water flow disturbance is established, fusion image enhancement algorithm based on Retinextheory is proposed to achieve fine perception of the target. The control method based on redundant resolution algorithm is adopted to establish the anti-interference controller of the manipulator, which can compensate the internal and external uncertain interference. Finally, stable underwater operation is realized. The target ranging method is used to solve the angle of each joint of the manipulator to complete the tracking and grasping of the target. Underwater experiments show that the algorithm can improve the clarity of underwater images, ensure the accuracy of robot capture, and optimize the UVMS control performance. © 2020 Wei Chen et al.},

abstract={In this work the kinematic redundancy resolution based on Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) has been exploited to path planning of a underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). Some objective functions are analyzed with the purpose to achieve the desired evolution of the configuration of the mobile manipulator when the position and orientation of the effector is imposed. In the proposed method, the generalized coordinates, additional kinematic constraints and relevant objectives functions are selected, in such a way that the base motion is implicitly limited while maximizing the whole system manipulability. Simulations for a ten dof vehicle-arm are developed, with the consideration of three objective functions for optimization. The results reveal that it is possible to choose among several solutions from the Pareto Front, according to the importance of each individual objective or in other way, there are an objective function that dominated the optimization process. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new trajectory tracking scheme for the constrained nonlinear underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). For overcoming the unmodeled uncertainties, external disturbances, and constraints of control inputs in the operation of UVMS, a modified constrained H∞ controller with a basic computed-torque controller (CTC) and a new designed nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) are proposed. The CTC gives the nominal model-based control. The NDO is designed based on the system dynamics and used to online provide the estimation of the lumped disturbances. However, the designed NDO is an observer of biased estimation, i.e., it has a blind domain of disturbance estimation which cannot be rejected. In order to reject the biased estimation, the modified constrained H∞ controller is designed but with new features. To the best of our knowledge, the conventional H∞ robust controller is generally designed by calculating the Riccati equation offline and ignoring the constraints of control inputs made by the physical actuators, which are poor in handling the time-varying environment. In order to solve these issues, the modified constrained H∞ robust controller online optimized by grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is designed to ensure the control system has a compensation of the biased estimation, a satisfied constrained control input, and a fast calculation. In this paper, we modify the prior method of offline calculating the Riccati equation of the conventional H∞ robust controller to be an online optimization scheme and proposed a new constrained evaluation function. The new constrained evaluation function is online optimized by the GWO, which can both find out the constrained suboptimal control actions and compensate the biased estimation of the NDO for the UVMS. The whole system stability is proved. The effectiveness of the fast online calculation, tracking accuracy, and lumped disturbances rejection is shown by a series of UVMS simulations. © 2020 Yong Dai et al.},

abstract={This paper presents the detailed modeling and simulation of the dynamic coupling between an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a manipulator. The modeling processes are described with the incorporation of the most dominating hydrodynamic effects such as added mass, lift and drag forces. The hydrodynamic coefficients are derived using strip theory and are adjusted according to dynamical similarity. A fuzzy decoupling controller (FDC) is proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) which consists of two subsystems, an underwater vehicle and a manipulator. The proposed controller uses a fuzzy algorithm (FA) to adaptively tune the gain matrix of the error function (EF). The EF is described by the integral sliding surface function. This technique allows the off-diagonal elements developed for decoupling the system to be incorporated in the gain matrix. Tracing the FA and EF back to the principle of feedback linearization, one further obtains evidence about the decoupling and stability of the system. Moreover, a desired trajectory with the consideration of the dynamic coupling of the AUV is designed to reduce the thruster forces and manipulator's torques. This technique provides high performance in terms of tracking error norms and expended energy norms. A major contribution of this study is that it adopts the off-diagonal elements to exploit the dynamic coupling between the degrees of freedom of the subsystem and the dynamic coupling between the two subsystems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={A fundamental network design problem is that of designing “efficient” routes for moving products, resources and information through a network. Usually the route must satisfy a variety of constraints. The efficiency of a network can be measured in terms of cost, reliability, throughput or length of path used. The constraints of a network can consist of delivery/pickup time deadlines, network availability, the need to visit specific nodes of the network, or resource restrictions such as vehicle capacity, fleet size or transmission rates to name a few. We consider a class of path design problems which arise when an object needs to traverse between two points through a specified region, the Transit Path Problem being one such problem. The Transit Path Problem is to determine an optimal path, in terms of minimizing risk or cost or maximizing reliability, for an object, such as a robot or vehicle, that needs to traverse a specified region between two points. This problem arises in many areas of real life. For example, the routing of military vehicles through a detection field or the routing of a new highway in a given terrain. Other applications include motion planning for robot manipulators through a field of obstacles and the generation of optimal trajectories for air, space, naval and land vehicles. We specifically look at the problem of determining an optimal transit path for a submarine moving through a field of sonar sensors, subject to a total time constraint. The strategy presented involves a two stage approach. The first stage is a discretization of the problem and the development of a network heuristic method, based upon a parameterisation using a convex combination, to solve the resulting network. The second stage involves the use of an optimal control model, the application of the CPET technique, and a solution procedure that utilizes the solution obtained in the first stage as a starting point. In the proposed model each of the sensors can detect the presence of the submarine with a probability which is a given function depending on the distance between the two and on the speed of the submarine. This function is not a simple analytical expression, but depends upon a range of factors, including the characteristics of the ocean floor and ocean surface, depths of the sensor and the submarine, and the temperature and salinity of the water. In this paper, we use probability of detection functions reported in (Hallam 1997). These were constructed under the assumptions that the geographic location and environmental conditions are known and that the submarine remains at a constant depth. Furthermore, each of the given functions is constructed for a particular constant vessel speed. While there are still further factors influencing the probability of detection (such as machinery states, frequency of the sensor, alertness of sensor operators or quality of the automatic detection, the relative aspect of the submarine and the sensor, the effect of sudden changes in travel direction or speed), the functions from (Hallam 1997) contain sufficient detail to test the feasibility of the proposed method. The overall probability of detection at any point in time can then be calculated as an appropriate combination of these individual probabilities of detection. Here, we make the assumption that the probability of detection for any one sensor is independent of the probabilities of detection for the other sensors. The objective then is to find a transit path between two fixed positions in the sensor field which will minimize the overall probability of detection while still satisfying a maximum travel time constraint. The difficulty is due to the fact that the transit time must satisfy an upper bound constraint. Computational results support the use of our methodology. They show the heuristic we use to be both efficient and satisfactory. The heuristic generates a good quality initial solution for the discretized network problem. This starting path is then refined by means of an optimal control approach. In this phase of our procedure we make use of the optimal control software package MISER3. Improvements can be made in the range of 9 to 34% by employing the optimal control approach. © MODSIM 2005 - International Congress on Modelling and Simulation: Advances and Applications for Management and Decision Making, Proceedings.

abstract={This paper presents an uncalibrated visual servoing scheme for underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs) with an eye-in-hand camera under uncertainties. These uncertainties contain vision sensor parameters, UVMS kinematics and feature position information. At first, a linear separation approach is addressed to collect these uncertainties into vectors, and this approach can also be utilized in other free-floating based manipulator systems. Secondly, a novel nonlinear adaptive controller is proposed to achieve image error convergence by estimating these vectors, the gradient projection method is utilized to optimize the restoring moments. Thirdly, a high order disturbance observer is addressed to deal with time-varying disturbances, and the convergence of the image errors is proved under the Lyapunov theory. Finally, in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical simulations based on a 9 degrees of freedom (DOFs) UVMS with an eye-in-hand camera are conducted. In simulations, the UVMS is expected to track a circle trajectory on the image plane, meanwhile, time-varying disturbances are exerted on the system. The proposed scheme can achieve accurate and smooth tracking results during simulations. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper presents a control scheme for addressing the moving target grabbing problem by a kinematically constrained redundant underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) in the presence of unmodeled uncertainties, sensory detecting noises, and time-varying external disturbances. Our proposed control scheme is designed by a robust fast tube model predictive controller (FTMPC) with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) target observer. The proposed robust FTMPC consists of an online fast nominal MPC and an online ancillary nonlinear controller to overcome the uncertainties and disturbances of the UVMS. The problem of the UVMS kinematic redundancy and mechanical/physical constraints is translated into a part of online optimization of FTMPC. The feasibility and stability of the FTMPC are proved. The proposed EKF observer is used to estimate the moving target trajectory and overcome the sensory measurement (system) noises, which can eliminate the assumption that most prior existing research works need to know the tracking reference trajectory precisely. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified through a series of UWSim simulations by the 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) vehicle and 5-DoF manipulator GIRONA500 UVMS. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Aiming at the problem that the control performance of the manipulator is easily affected in the complex underwater working environment, but the traditional control method is not effective, an intelligent controller based on the fuzzy RBF (radial basis function) neural network method is proposed to control the underwater manipulator precisely and stably. In the water disturbance environment, the manipulator was usually affected by the additional mass, water resistance and buoyancy. The Lagrange method and Morison equation were used to establish a dynamics model of the two-bar manipulator, which included those hydrodynamic terms mentioned above. By using the fuzzy RBF neural network, the hydrodynamics uncertainties in the dynamics equation of the underwater manipulator were identified overall and fitted. With the advantages of heuristic search of fuzzy system and high reasoning speed of RBF neural network, the control performance of underwater manipulator system had better precision and strong adaptability. Considering the hydrodynamic terms, the stability of the underwater manipulator system was proved by using Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the simulation experiment of trajectory tracking control for a two-bar manipulator was carried out by using MATLAB, and the control effect of fuzzy RBF neural network, conventional RBF neural network identification method and traditional fuzzy control method was compared. The simulation results showed that compared with the conventional RBF neural network identification method, under the control of fuzzy RBF neural network, the response time and relative error of joint 1 of the two-bar manipulator was reduced by 91% and 88%, the response time and relative error of joint 2 was reduced by 92% and 77%; compared with the traditional fuzzy control method, the relative error of joint 1 and joint 2 was reduced by 65% and 10%. The research results show that the control effect of fuzzy RBF neural network is better than that of conventional RBF neural network identification method and traditional fuzzy control, which can provides a high precision and effective control method for the underwater manipulator control. © 2019 Zhejiang University Press.},

abstract={The article deals with the technology of constructing a 3-D velocity field mathematical model for flow around manipulators of anthropomorphic robots, such as the SAR-400 robot, when subjected to wave and constant currents. The studies show that when building control systems for manipulators operating underwater, it is necessary to take into account the arising forces acting on the manipulators as external disturbances that impede the precise fulfillment of control tasks. Methods for calculating 3-D velocity fields under the influence of wave and constant currents on the structural elements of manipulators of an underwater anthropomorphic robot as cylinders of large and small elongations are considered. A numerical simulation of the evolution of the flow velocity and pressure fields in a flow past a cylinder has been performed. The proposed approaches will allow the simulation of external disturbances acting on the manipulators of the robot working under water when constructing their control laws. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The compensation, color compensation and other processes realize the fine perception of underwater targets; using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the spatial feedback linear transformation matrix to construct the robot anti-interference controller to compensate the internal and external uncertainty disturbances and achieve underwater stability operation; The target ranging method is used to solve the joint angles of the manipulators, and the tracking and grasping of the target objects are completed. Underwater experiments show that the algorithm can not only improve the dynamic stability of the UVMS system, but also ensure the accuracy of underwater robot grabbing and optimize system control performance. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Summary This paper presents a hybrid strategy-based coordinate controller with a novel nonlinear disturbance observer for autonomous underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs). This method can reduce the influence from external unknown disturbances, inner coupling effects and model uncertainties by using a modified disturbance observer. Considering the natural redundancy property of the UVMS, the redundancy resolution algorithm is often utilized to give desired trajectories in the vehicle-joint space. However, because of the calibration errors, assembling errors and numerical errors, these desired trajectories may not lead the end-effector to the goal point accurately. To realize accurate motion control even when small errors exist in the planning phase, a hybrid strategy is introduced to transform the controller in the joint-vehicle space to the controller in the task space. Numerical simulations based on a UVMS have been carried out to testify the effectiveness of the proposed coordinate controller and the hybrid strategy. During the simulations, unknown disturbances are exerted upon the system. The trajectory tracking and error fixing performances are discussed in comparative analyses. The controller also maintains robust characteristics in comparison with the passivity-based controller and the proposed controller but without the disturbance observer. Experiments are also carried out to test its performance. © Cambridge University Press 2019.},

Radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are used in the disturbance observer to approximate the unknown external disturbances, which can improve the robustness of the control system. Moreover, an improved reaching law is applied in the NFTSM strategy to quicken the response of input signals in the different control period. Afterward, it can be demonstrated that all the state signals are ultimately bounded via the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, numerical simulation results are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={A double closed-loop integral sliding mode UVMS(Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System) controller that can effectively overcome the uncertainty of dynamic parameters and current disturbance and significantly improve sliding mode chattering is designed. In actual marine operations, due to the complex underwater environment, it is difficult for UVMS to establish an accurate dynamic model and there are time-varying current disturbances outside it, which makes it difficult to control the motion of UVMS. Aiming at these problems, a double closed-loop integral sliding mode controller which is easy to apply in engineering and has good dynamic performance is designed. This controller can reduce the sliding mode chatter by designing the integral sliding surface instead of the traditional sliding surface and using the continuous hyperbolic tangent function instead of the discontinuous switching function. Moreover, it is not sensitive to hydrodynamic parameter changes and current disturbances and has strong robustness. Furthermore, the double closed-loop sliding mode structure makes the controller have faster convengence speed and better stability. At the same time, it does not need to identify parameters online, so it is also easy to implement physically. Finally, The simulation experiments of the UVMS are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the controller. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={A fractional integral sliding mode control scheme was proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problems of underwater manipulators with unknown and bounded external disturbances. The proposed method was made with the adoption of the exponential reaching law that was based on a fractional integral sliding mode surface and with one term added as the approximate estimate for the external disturbances, which made it possible to achieve fast convergence and have strong capacity of resisting disturbances for the systems. Moreover, the stability of the closed-loop system could be guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations of the six degree-of-freedom (DOF) underwater manipulators shows promising results that validate the high-precision tracking performance and the better robustness of the proposed control systems against external disturbances. © 2019, China Mechanical Engineering Magazine Office.

abstract={This paper presents an algorithmic solution for depth control. Depth control for Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) is essential to complete a specific underwater manipulation. A large number of algorithms have been designed to tackle the depth control problem. However, because of water currents, algorithm for depth control is required strong robustness. This work describes an adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) method to implement the depth control. The designed SMC method combining the proposed adaptive algorithm can alleviate influence of uncertain parameters of system and external disturbances. The stability is proven by a Lyapunov function. Then, we build a ROS-based underwater simulation environment-UWSim. Real-time depth and velocity of UVMS can be obtained by depth gauge and IMU via ROS nodes. Finally, we conduct a depth control simulation with our proposed hybrid-driven underwater vehicle-manipulator system (HD-UVMS). A comparative simulation is also implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of a fleet containment under the leader-follower strategy with direct topology. The complete fleet navigation, guidance and control have been designed using L1 adaptive control and the artificial potential field formation-based approach. The framework is developed to control the navigation and formation of a fleet of underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMs). The proposed containment control approach is a distributed cascade control structure composed of a navigation and guidance controller and a tracking controller. For the path tracking control, L1 adaptive is applied to the general equations of motion of the underwater vehicle equipped with a 3 link manipulator owing to its ability to achieve fast and robust adaptation. Potential field like control has been used for navigation and guidance. The objective is to ensure robust formation maintenance while in motion or in a standby position. Simulation results show the performance of the control approach even when subjected to ocean disturbances. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper proposes an improved Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach including a fuzzy compensator in order to track desired trajectories of autonomous Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems (UVMS). The tracking performance can be affected by robot dynamical model uncertainties and applied external disturbances. Nevertheless, the MPC as a known proficient nonlinear control approach should be improved by the uncertainty estimator and disturbance compensator particularly in high nonlinear circumstances such as underwater environment in which operation of the UVMS is extremely impressed by added nonlinear terms to its model. In this research, a new methodology is proposed to promote robustness virtue of MPC that is done by designing a fuzzy compensator based on the uncertainty and disturbance estimation in order to reduce or even omit undesired effects of these perturbations. The proposed control design is compared with conventional MPC control approach to confirm the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of robustness against uncertainties, guaranteed stability and precision. © 2019 Hossein Nejatbakhsh Esfahani, published by Sciendo 2019.},

abstract={This paper presents a unified motion planning approach for an Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) in a cluttered environment with localization uncertainty. With the uncertainty being propagated by an information filter, a trajectory optimization problem closed by a Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian controller is formulated for a coupled design of optimal trajectory, localization, and control. Due to the presence of obstacles or complexity of the cluttered environment, a set of feasible initial I-AUV trajectories covering multiple homotopy classes are required by optimization solvers. Parameterized through polynomials, the initial base trajectories are from solving quasi-quadratic optimization problems that are linearly constrained by waypoints from RRTconnect, while the initial trajectories of the manipulator are generated by a null space saturation controller. Simulations on an I-AUV with a 3 DOF manipulator in cluttered underwater environments demonstrated that initial trajectories are generated efficiently and that optimal and collision-free I-AUV trajectories with low state uncertainty are obtained. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Standard adaptive control approaches may not be able to sufficiently stabilize underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMSs) when wave disturbances are large, leading to high-frequency oscillations of large amplitude in its dynamic model parameters. Such parameters bring about undesired oscillations in the vehicle body control and state. This paper extends a frequency-limited adaptive control approach to the vehicle body. An auxiliary model is obtained from the approximated model through a low-pass filter and is used to reduce the problematic oscillations. The resultant stable vehicle body is a necessary premise for successful end-effector tracking. In addition, this paper proposes a sufficient condition of the control gains for guaranteed asymptotical stability of the controlled robotic system. Numerical simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the presented approach, compared to the standard adaptive control. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a method of liner active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) is presented for underwater vehicle manipulators system (UVMS) with 2-links. First, the UVMS is separated into five subsystems. For each subsystem, the hydrodynamic force and coupling effects from other subsystems are all lumped as total disturbance. Subsequently, a linear extended state observer (LESO) and LADRC are designed for each subsystem, where the convergence of LESO is analyzed. Then the LADRC methods is proposed for each subsystem and an overall LADRC method is proposed for UVMS. Finally, Simulation examples are demonstrated to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a real-time collision detection algorithm for underwater robotic manipulation. It is capable of detecting collisions between multiple manipulators and between manipulators and obstacles in the workspace. Assuming operations are typically carried out on artificial structures with a known geometry, it is possible to model the environment from a priori known CAD models. The position of objects in the workspace is tracked using a vision based approach that relies on fiducial marker detection. The proposed collision detection method is developed, integrated into a commercial ROV manipulator control system, and successfully evaluated in simulations and experimental setup using a real industry standard underwater manipulator. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a receding horizon (RH) motion planner is developed for an underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS) consisting of an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and a robotic arm with multiple joints. The desired task is assigned as driving the end effector to a predefined pose while keeping roll and pitch of the UUV in a small range. Model-based constraints such as input saturations and mechanical limits are explicitly considered within the RH framework, and thus the generated velocities are executable for the real system. Compared with the task priority control approach, which has been widely studied for motion planning of UVMSs, the RH planner is better in its optimality and capability to deal with complicated environments and mission requirements. Performance of these two approaches is compared in simulation studies and effectiveness of the proposed RH motion planner is verified. © 2018 IEEE.},

However, the system's parametric uncertainty and external disturbance increase the difficulty in designing an appropiate controller. In this paper, the term including parametric uncertainty and external disturbance is estimated using uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE). Then, the term is incorporated into a sliding mode control (SMC) method to compensate the uncertainties in hydrodynamic parameters of the vehicle and reject the external disturbance. The proposed UDE-SMC control scheme do not include the switching functin of SMC, which descreases the chattering effect of SMC. In addition, due to the system's kinematic redundancy, the inverse kinematic method based on pseudo-inverse of Jacobian matric is presented to investigate redundancy resolution. The main contribution of this paper is that it presents a simple model-based trajectory tracking controller for UVMS. Finally, the numerical simulations along with the comparative study are conducted. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Existing belief space motion planning methods are not efficient for underwater robots that are subject to spatially varying motion and sensing uncertainties arising from the non-uniform current disturbances and landmark populations, respectively. Based on a closed-loop stochastic control framework, we propose a fast Gaussian belief space planning approach for coupled optimization of trajectory, localization and control, resulting in a non-linear programming problem (NLP). In particular, as opposed to advancing the covariance by a Kalman filter in the existing literature, we utilize an upper bound of the trace propagation of the covariance, thereby avoiding to solve Riccati equations and thus, reducing the computational complexity. The NLP is then efficiently solved by sequential quadratic programming based on the initial solutions obtained from RRT-connect. These initials lie in multiple homotopy classes guaranteed by H-signature discrimination, leading to global optimality with probability one as the number of samples in RRT-connect goes to infinity. Numerical simulations on holonomic and non-holonomic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and an Intervention-AUV with a manipulator in cluttered underwater environments demonstrate that optimal and collision-free trajectories with low localization uncertainty are obtained efficiently. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a motion planning method that reduces the thrust of underwater robots moving a manipulator. The proposed method plans motion with 12-degree-of-freedom (12-DOF) for underwater robot, including 6-DOF for Body and 6-DOF for the manipulator. 2-DOF are used for the body’s orientation, roll and pitch and 3-DOF for manipulator position and orientation each. While the robot performs a task, if the thrust of the underwater robot is close to the limit of thruster, the underwater robot reduces its thrust by moving the center of the mass (COM) of the manipulator using null-space control without disturbing the task. The proposed method has been verified via simulation, by planning motion such that the thrust of the underwater robot is reduced under the limit of thrusters. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={Recently, Intervention-Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUVs), started to grab researchers attention. While prior systems rely on variations of the task-priority redundancy control framework, our recent research demonstrated experimental results using search-based motion planning for a single arm floating-based intervention in known and unknown environments. In this work, we present a search-based motion planning algorithm applied to the coordinated manipulation problem of a dual-arm Intervention AUV, in an object transportation mission (e.g. pipe transportation). Two Challenges are considered: the high-dimensionality of the system, and the motion coordination between the mobile base and both working arms. The latter challenge is a major one if accurate execution is required, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV. Our approach relies on exploiting the loose coupling between the different system components. We show for the first time the use of a search-based planner on a dual-arm underwater manipulator. In addition, we support our claims with a simulated demonstration, successfully performing a coordinated dual-arm underwater intervention. © 2019. The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The development and research of the new synthesis method of the control system for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with a multilink manipulator is described in the paper. This system provides an automatic soil sampling and the taking of geological samples of a sea bottom surface. In automatic mode, the developed system defines the location of a bottom surface relative to the AUV by means of the onboard multibeam Doppler lag. During the vehicle immersion, the system evaluates the complexity of the bottom relief in the working area and makes decision on the suitability of the said relief for the trouble-free implementation of the specified manipulative tasks. Also, the proposed system realises the formation algorithm for spatial trajectories of the multilink underwater manipulator's working tool and defines the AUV spatial orientation and position at which the performing of manipulation operations occurs most efficiently and safely. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The need for development of underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMS) is on the rise owing to the increased requirement for underwater operations. To perform handle valve turning task, which is important task of underwater operation, three underwater manipulation methods can be considered. Single- and dual-arm manipulation methods comprise the first two types. The dual-arm manipulation requires the turning operation to be performed by grabbing two points on the valve handle. The third method is also of the dual-arm type with one arm grabbing a point on the valve handle while the other clamping onto a point located in the surrounding environment; for example, underwater pipes. Kinematic and dynamic models were derived for each case, and a dynamic simulation involving disturbances were performed with valve-turning. Results verify that especially under the existence of disturbances, the dual-arm manipulation method involving holding onto the environment is superior in performance and reliability compared to the other two methods. Therefore, this paper proves the advantages of grabbing environments with simulation results in UVMS. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle or I-AUV has recently started to grab researchers attention in the last 20 years. Only three I-AUVs have demonstrated autonomous manipulation skills: ALIVE, SAUVIM and GIRONA 500. While prior systems rely on variations of the task-priority redundancy control framework, our recent research showed preliminary results using motion planning for floating-based intervention in the presence of obstacles. With the increasing need for autonomously performing more complex manipulation tasks, two main challenges need to be addressed: the high-dimensionality of the system, and the motion coordination between the mobile base and the working arm. The latter challenge is of high importance if accurate execution is required, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV and the control challenges that come with it. Our approach relies on exploiting the loose coupling between the AUV and the arm. In particular we present an approach based on MR-MHA ∗ (Multi-Representation, Multi-Heuristic A∗), and we show how it can generate efficient trajectories by exploiting decoupling. We show for the first time the use of a search-based planner on a high-dimensional underwater manipulator. In addition, we support our claims with experimental analysis of the generated trajectories with respect to various metrics in different environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to conduct a full intervention mission in a realistic simulated underwater intervention environment. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Underwater hydraulic manipulator with the advantages of heavy load and mature technology, is widely used in ROV and HOV, however, the autonomous operating ability of ROV or HOV’s manipulator is relatively weak. To solve this problem, in this paper, an underwater autonomous dual manipulator platform is developed which would be utilized in key technology research on underwater IMR (Inspection, Maintenance and Repair), ocean exploration and other marine applications to alleviate the operating burden and improve working efficiency. Using the same manipulator configuration as the 6000m Scientific ROV of SIA, the platform is comprised of two underwater hydraulic manipulators and has a three-axis motion base of the manipulators. Additionally, the control system is based on the ROS (Robot Operating System) and MoveIt!. This paper tends to illustrate some fundamental research of the platform, such as the system overview of the platform, modeling, motion planning in Matlab and ROS, and the computer-based control of single manipulator. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a visual servo control scheme with base motion compensation using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is presented for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) performing intervention tasks. It is assumed that the underwater vehicle is dynamically positioned by a station keeping controller in uncertain motion under disturbances of the environment and the manipulator. To control the free-floating manipulator (FFM) accurately, we propose an eye-in-hand visual servo controller with a disturbance compensator (DC-VSC). The velocity of the base is estimated by an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with visual measurements based on the kinematic model of the UVMS. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed DC-VSC, which tracks the stationary visual target in the presence of an uncertain moving base. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Underwater vehicles are being emphasized as highly integrated and intelligent devices for a significant number of oceanic operations. However, their precise operation is usually hindered by disturbances from a tether or manipulator because their propellers are unable to realize a stable suspension. A dynamic multi-body model-based adaptive controller was designed to allow the controller of the vehicle to observe and compensate for disturbances from a tether or manipulator. Disturbances, including those from a tether or manipulator, are deduced for the observation of the controller. An analysis of a tether disturbance covers the conditions of the surface, the underwater area, and the vehicle end point. Interactions between the vehicle and manipulator are mainly composed of coupling forces and restoring moments. To verify the robustness of the controller, path-following experiments on a streamlined autonomous underwater vehicle experiencing various disturbances were conducted in Song Hua Lake in China. Furthermore, path-following experiments for a tethered open frame remote operated vehicle were verified for accurate cruising with a controller and an observer, and vehicle and manipulator coordinate motion control during the simulation and experiments verified the effectiveness of the controller and observer for underwater operation. This study provides instructions for the control of an underwater vehicle experiencing disturbances from a tether or manipulator. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={A double-loop fractional integral sliding mode control (DLFISMC) strategy is designed to solve the trajectory tracking problem of an underwater manipulator with bounded external disturbance, which is composed of the outer loop position control and the inner loop velocity one. On the basis of the fractional theory and the stability method, the sliding mode surfaces and the reaching laws are designed respectively. In addition, an auxiliary is introduced to the inner loop controller to estimate the external disturbance. The Lyapunov theory can ensure the finite-time convergence and stability of the closed-loop system. The simulation results from a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) underwater manipulator validate the higher precision tracking performance and better robustness of the proposed control system against the external disturbance. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper deals with a motion control scheme for autonomous underwater robots equipped with manipulators. It is pointed out in the literature on underwater robotics that the robot body propelled by marine thrusters generally has a considerably slower time response than the manipulator driven by electric motors. Moreover, for a real system, it is generally difficult to precisely control the position of a vehicle floating in water by means of hydrodynamic effects produced by the rotations of thrusters' propellers. In this paper, we develop a motion controller for the manipulator in consideration of the thruster dynamics including a control input of the vehicle under the condition that the vehicle is differently controlled by a motion controller that can achieve not a precise control performance but a motion stability in the presence of disturbances such as water waves or a water current. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last years, the development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) with attached robotic manipulators, the so-called Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System (UVMS), has gained significant research attention, due to the ability of interaction with underwater environments. In such applications, force/torque controllers which guarantee that the end-effector of the UVMS applies desired forces/torques towards the environment, should be designed in a way that state and input constraints are taken into consideration. Furthermore, due to their complicated structure, unmodeled dynamics as well as external disturbances may arise. Motivated by this, we proposed a robust Model Predicted Control Methodology (NMPC) methodology which can handle the aforementioned constraints in an efficient way and it guarantees that the end-effector is exerting the desired forces/torques towards the environment. Simulation results verify the validity of the proposed framework. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={To ensure satisfactory control performance for the underwater vehicle-manipulator systems, a novel continuous nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller is proposed and investigated using time delay estimation in this article. Complex lumped unknown dynamics including the strong nonlinear couplings and external disturbance are properly compensated with time delay estimation, which are mainly based on the time-delayed signals of underwater vehicle-manipulator systems and can provide with a fascinating model-free feature. Afterwards, the satisfactory tracking control performance and good robustness under heavy lumped uncertainties are ensured using the continuous nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode term with a fast terminal sliding mode–type reaching law. Therefore, the proposed controller is easy to use thanks to time delay estimation, and can ensure good control performance owing to continuous nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode. Stability of the closed-loop control system is analyzed using Lyapunov stability theory, and theoretical tracking errors are calculated and presented. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed controller are demonstrated through comparative 7-degree-of-freedom pool experiments. © IMechE 2017.},

abstract={As marine resources development and marine science research increasingly improve, manipulators are mounted on the unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to fulfil a series of complex underwater operation tasks. The control of underwater vehicle manipulator system(UVMS) is difficult to directly realize for high-dimensional kinematical and dynamical resolving, cumulative error effect and aggravated modelling uncertainty; Position and attitude control of the end effector is essential for accurate accomplishment of typical tasks, which depends greatly on whether the UUV could stably maintain a desired position and attitude. Concentrating on the dynamic positioning of UUV in the presence of disturbances caused by working manipulators, a fuzzy switching sliding mode control method is adopted and enhanced by a dynamic normalization factor. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and engineering realizability of the proposcd approach. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel bilateral adaptive control scheme to achieve position and force coordination performance of underwater manipulator teleoperation system under model uncertainty and external disturbance. A new nonlinear model reference adaptive impedance controller with bound-gain-forgetting (BGF) composite adaptive law is designed for the master manipulator force tracking of the slave manipulator. The reference position in task space is obtained from the linear second-order impedance model whose input is the force error of the master and the slave. The adaptive terminal sliding mode control based on adaptive uncertainty compensation is proposed to achieve the master position tracking of the reference position. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) local approximation method is proposed for the slave manipulator's position tracking. The RBFNN based on Ge-Lee (GL) matrix is adopted to directly approximate each element of the slave manipulator dynamic, and the robust term with a proper update law is designed to suppress the error between the estimate model and the real model, and the external disturbance. The asymptotic tracking performance and global stability of the teleoperation system are proved with Lyapunov stability theorem. The simulation and experiment verify the performance of the proposed controller in teleoperation manipulator model. The results show that the teleoperation system has a good ability of position and force coordination. © 2018},

abstract={Precise motion control of remotely operated vehicles plays an important role in a great number of submarine missions. However, the high-performance operations are difficult to realize due to the uncertainty in system modeling with self-disturbance. On the basis of the multibody system dynamics, self-disturbances from the tether and manipulator have been systematically analyzed in order to transform them into observed forces. A novel S surface–based adaptive recurrent wavelet neural network control system has been proposed on the nonlinear control of underwater vehicles, with its recurrent wavelet neural network structure designed for the approximation of the uncertain dynamics. Moreover, a robust function has been proposed to improve system robustness and convergence. The comparison shows that the remotely operated vehicle operation performance including the three-dimensional path following and vehicle-manipulator coordinate control has been greatly improved. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Sampling-based, search-based, and optimization-based motion planners are just some of the different approaches developed for motion planning problems. Given the wide variety of application tackled by autonomous mobile manipulators, the question “which planner to choose” may be tough. In this paper, we review the state of the art of the most common approaches, and present a set of benchmarks with the aim to provide not only a theoretical review but also a qualitative/quantitative comparison of the algorithms. Our purpose is to provide an insight and analyze their performance with respect to different metrics. The results are based on an Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System UVMS, although they can be extended to terrestrial and aerial robots as well. The paper uses these results to formalize a set of guidelines for the selection process of the most appropriate approach, for a given problem/requirements. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper describes the state-of-the art in the area of underwater robot manipulator systems. A brief introduction is given on the use of manipulators in various offshore industries for different subsea intervention applications. It provides a comprehensive summary of existing commercial and prototype underwater manipulators, covering relevant aspects such as design features, their capabilities and merits, and provides a detailed comparison. This is followed by a thorough analysis of advantages and disadvantages of both electrically and hydraulically actuated manipulators. Furthermore, a detailed description of commercially available underwater manipulator control systems is presented in order to provide a realistic picture of the existing technology and its limitation. In addition, an extensive bibliography covering research results in the field of control algorithms is presented, including low level motion control, high level kinematic control and motion planning schemes along with the implementation issues. © 2018 University of Limerick},

abstract={An adaptive bilateral control strategy is proposed for the uncertainty of the mathematical model and external disturbances during the teleoperation of underwater manipulator. A reference adaptive impedance control law based on the nominal model is designed for the uncertainty of the parameters of the master manipulator model and the external disturbance. The reference position of the expected model is adjusted by the deviation between the force of operator and the slave manipulator, and the model uncertainty is compensated by the adaptive control law. Aimed at the uncertainty of slave manipulator, the adaptive compensation is achieved by the radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and the approximation deviation is eliminated by the design of the sliding mode variable structure controller and the robust adaptive controller, which satisfies the position tracking of the slave manipulator to the master manipulator. The tracking performance and global stability are proved by Lyapunov function, and the asymptotic convergence of force-position tracking is guaranteed. The results show that the overall controller has good force-position tracking ability under the conditions of model uncertainty and external disturbance. The whole system is stable and feasible, and has robustness and adaptive control ability. © 2018, Editorial Board of JBUAA. All right reserved.},

abstract={Underwater operations in the traditional aquaculture are mainly carried out by manual labor, and it is labor-intensive and dangerous, at the same time the aquaculture industry is facing a severe labor crisis. With the advancement of technologies and the reduction of manufacturing costs, there is a huge demand for the application of underwater robots for aquaculture operations. The underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) is a new type of underwater operational robots. In recent years, the research of UVMS has gradually attracted the attention of scholars at home and abroad, and the application of UVMS to aquaculture fishing operations has a broad prospect. UVMS is a multibody dynamics system with dynamic coupling between the robot body and the manipulator. The modeling and control of the UVMS in the floating situation is very complicated, and its coupling control is not only affected by the conservation of momentum, but also affected by hydrodynamics. In addition, the aquaculture underwater operation environment is complex, the light is dim, the ocean current is time-varying, the target animals (sea cucumber, dead fish) are different in size, and the precision and speed requirements of the fishing operation are high, and the rapid identification of target animals and precision fishing operations are recognized challenges for the aquaculture community for many years. The application of UMVS to aquaculture fishing operations requires addressing several key technical issues, such as real-time target object recognition in complex environment, dynamics analysis and modeling of the UVMS as a multibody object, dynamic estimation of the underwater vehicle position relative to a target object, and constrained optimal guidance and control of UVMS under uncertainties. In order to provide a theoretical basis and comprehensive reference for the software development of aquaculture underwater robots, this paper focuses on the analysis and discussion of the role as well as the domestic and foreign research status of the aforementioned key technologies involved in UVMS fishing operations, and looks into the research prospects of the key technologies. In the research of key technologies for aquaculture underwater robots, the following suggestions should be noted: 1) Using multi-sensor information fusion technology to study the fast and accurate recognition algorithm of target animals under complex environment and disturbance conditions, and improving the target recognition speed and accuracy of aquaculture underwater operation robots are the inevitable direction of future research; 2) The development of integrated navigation systems with high reliability, high integration and comprehensive compensation and correction functions represents the development trend of aquaculture underwater robot navigation technology; 3) Under the premise of ensuring the stability of motion control of aquaculture underwater robots, improving the adaptability and fault tolerance of the control system, and continuously improving the feasibility of the intelligent system in practical applications are the focus of future research work. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

abstract={Soft robots have several promising features for underwater manipulation, e.g., safe interaction with surroundings, lightweight, low inertia, etc. In this paper, we proposed a method for the inverse kinematics of the soft manipulator that can move in the three-dimensional space. By controlling the two bending segments to move with opposing curvatures and one elongation segment to move up and down, our method enabled the real-time solution of the inverse kinematics and allowed the tip of the manipulator executing point-point movements in three dimensions. We performed the trajectory planning ability of the soft manipulator following the straight line and circle paths. Furthermore, we investigated the hydrodynamic functions of the soft manipulator underwater including forces, and the wake flows when the soft arm stroked at different amplitudes and frequencies. We found that the hydrodynamic force (<1N) and the torques (<0.1Nm) were quite small during locomotion-which led to a negligible inertial impact on the underwater vehicle compared to the traditional rigid underwater manipulator. Finally, we demonstrated that the soft manipulator successfully picked and placed sea animals at 10m depth. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This letter presents a new method to address the problem of task-constrained motion planning for aerial manipulators. We propose a control-aware planner based on the paradigm of tight coupling between planning and control. Such paradigm is especially useful in aerial manipulation, where the separation between planning and control is not advisable. The proposed sampling based motion planner uses a controller composed of a second-order inverse kinematics algorithm and a dynamic tracker, as a local planner, thus allowing a more natural consideration of the closed-loop system dynamics. For task-constrained motions, this method let us to sample directly in the reduced and more relevant task space, predict the behavior of the controller avoiding motions that bring to singularities or large tracking errors, and guarantee the correct execution of the maneuver. The method is tested in simulation for a multidirectional-thrust vehicle endowed with a 2-DoF manipulator. The proposed approach is very general, and could be applied to ground and underwater robotic systems to perform manipulation or inspection tasks. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a robust finite time trajectory tracking control approach is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which belongs to the class of highly nonlinear, coupled dynamics with motion in 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The finite-time error convergence and robust control task is accomplished by designing a non-singular fast fuzzy terminal sliding mode controller (NFFTSMC) with disturbance estimator for the 6-DOF dynamics of an AUV. The proposed NFFTSMC incorporates a non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC) which not only assures faster and finite convergence of the tracking errors to the equilibrium from anywhere in the phase portrait but also eliminates the issue of singularity dilemma appeared in conventional terminal sliding mode controller (TSMC); a fuzzy logic control (FLC) tool is employed to generate the hitting control signal in order to reduce chattering in control inputs, which commonly occur in conventional TSMC, and an estimated uncertainty term to compensate for the un-modeled dynamics, external disturbances, and time-varying parameters. Furthermore to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it has been extended to task space control problem of an AUV - manipulator system (AUVMS) employed for underwater manipulation tasks. Simulation studies confirms the potency of the proposed method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In the arc welding process of underwater welding robot, in order to improve the welding quality and the welding efficiency, a smooth trajectory control strategy was presented. Firstly, the mathematical model of the welding robot was established and the kinematics analysis was carried out by using the D-H parameter method. The forward kinematics and inverse kinematics formulas of the robot were deduced and the position formula of the robot was simplified. Then, the 6-dimensional space vector was proposed to represent the position and posture of the robot at each path point; Finally, a linear interpolation method with parabolic transition was used to interpolate the robot's space pose. At the same time, the speed and acceleration of each joint of the welding robot were calculated rationally, which can ensure a smooth welding process. The underwater welding experiment was carried out by using the above control strategy. The result showed that welding seam was smooth, and the welding quality was improved and the welding time was shortened. © 2018, Editorial Board of Transactions of the China Welding Institution, Magazine Agency Welding.

abstract={This paper addresses the achievement of floating autonomous manipulation of the underwater biomimetic vehicle-manipulator system (UBVMS). A practical vehicle-manipulator coordinated plan and control methodology of the UBVMS for autonomous interventions are designed. First, the system configuration is introduced, and the optimal work space is confirmed. Then, the control framework of the UBVMS mainly consisting of online motion planning, multitask kinematic control, dynamic feedforward compensation, and adaptive parameter undulatory control for autonomous manipulation is presented. The online motion planning method with resort to tracking differentiator is developed to produce desired task trajectory and reference rate. The singularity-robust multitask kinematic control algorithm with state observers is designed to obtain system reference velocity. The couple influence on the vehicle induced by the presence of the manipulator is described as the dynamic feedforward compensation signal to reduce undesired waggle of the UBVMS. Adaptive parameter modifier of the biomimetic propulsor is designed to satisfy multifarious performance requirements in different motion phases. Finally, pool experiments in multiple scenarios for autonomous grasping manipulation are conducted to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the developed coordinated plan and control strategy. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A novel nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) method based on time delay estimation (TDE) was proposed in order to solve the trajectory tracking control problem of underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) under the unknown complex lumped disturbance. TDE was used as the baisc framework and the strong roubustness of NTSMC was combined to realize the high performance trajectory tracking control under complex lunmped disturbance. The method can ensure good control performance, strong robustness and easiness for practical applications benefiting from the attractive model-free feature of TDE and the strong robustness of NTSMC. Comparative 9 degree of freedoms (DOFs) numerical simulations and 7 DOFs pool experimental studies were conducted using a UVMS developed in our laboratory. Results show that the method can ensure better comprehensive control performance compared with the traditional TDE-based control method using the same control gains under the unknown complex lumped disturbance. The former system can ensure a precision of 0.038 m for the end effector of the UVMS while the latter one can obtain a precision of 0.067 m. © 2018, Zhejiang University Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={The trajectory tracking control problem of operational AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) is addressed. In general, the stretching and operation processes of underwater manipulator will lead to changes of AUV dynamic performance, which will affect the AUV trajectory tracking control, and so does the water current. Aiming at the trajectory tracking control problem of AUV, an adaptive terminal sliding mode control method based on RBF (radial basis function) neural network is proposed. Under the framework of Lyapunov stability theory, the RBF neural network is used to approximate the changes of AUV dynamic performance caused by the stretching of the manipulator and the disturbance of the water current online. Then combined with the adaptive terminal sliding mode controller, the weights of neural network and control parameters of AUV are adaptively adjusted online. According to the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the system trajectory tracking error of AUV is uniformly stable and bounded. Aiming at the chattering problem caused by the sliding mode control items, a chattering reduction method for the saturated continuous function with variable sliding mode gain is proposed to reduce the chattering of sliding mode control variables. Experiments on heading and vertical trajectory tracking are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the AUV system control method and the sliding mode chattering reduction method. © 2018, Science Press.

abstract={Open frame underwater vehicles tend to be affected by the disturbances caused by manipulator, tether, waves and other factors.In order to reduce the influence of disturbances, in this article a model-based adaptive anti-disturbance control(AADC)method for open frame underwater vehicles was proposed.The models of disturbances caused by manipulator and tether was analyzed, and an AADC method in details based on global dynamic control loop and disturbances compensation terms was established.Experiments carried out on SY-Ⅱ open frame underwater vehicle to compare the AADC with the S surface control show that manipulator and tether indeed caused certain disturbances on the vehicle.The AADC method shows higher control accuracy through the estimation and compensation of disturbance in deep keeping, orientation keeping and path following experiments.When it comes to the position keeping experiments while the manipulator is at work, AADC method is robust against disturbance, hence generating smoother trajectory in vehicle motion and showing better stability performance than S surface control. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Tianjin University(Science and Technology).

abstract={Work-class ROVs equipped with robotic manipulators are extensively used for subsea intervention operations. Manipulators are teleoperated by human pilots relying on visual feedback from the worksite. Operating in a remote environment, with limited pilot perception and poor visibility, manipulator collisions which may cause significant damage are likely to happen. This paper presents a real-time collision detection algorithm for marine robotic manipulation. The proposed collision detection mechanism is developed, integrated into a commercial ROV manipulator control system, and successfully evaluated in simulations and experimental setup using a real industry standard underwater manipulator. The presented collision sensing solution has a potential to be a useful pilot assisting tool that can reduce the task load, operational time, and costs of subsea inspection, repair, and maintenance operations. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={This paper aims to investigate the method of 3-D helical path following of an underwater biomimetic vehicle-manipulator system (UBVMS) propelled by undulatory fins (RobCutt-II). By mimicking the unique undulatory propulsion mode of cuttlefish, we hope that RobCutt-II could obtain good low-speed stability, which helps to perform stable and effective underwater operations. For some underwater applications, the UBVMS should autonomously generate and pass through a helical path around specific object for survey and intervention. Therefore, a path-following control scheme is proposed. In particular, the path generator provides a 3-D helical path according to the target position and the specific constraint conditions. To follow the generated path in underwater space, the control architecture, which consists of a guidance system, three active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) subcontrollers, and fuzzy method for control allocation, is proposed. Finally, two experiments conducted on the prototype RobCutt-II illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={For solving the trajectory tracking problem of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system (UVMS) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances, this paper presents an indirect adaptive control scheme which consists of three parts: an extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimation compensative system, a model-based computed torque controller (CTC), a H∞ robust compensative tracking controller. The contribution of our method is that it can overcome the disadvantages of existing control schemes, which are based on the accurate dynamic model of UVMS, known statistics unmodeled dynamics/external disturbances (e.g., constant or Gaussian), or the accurate, efficient system feedback measurement states by the sensors. According to the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is shown that the proposed indirect adaptive control scheme can guarantee its embedded H∞ robust controller tracking performance for our UVMS. Simulations show that the proposed control scheme can satisfy the design requirements of UVMS in rapid convergence, tracking accuracy, system stability and disturbance attenuation. Therefore, the method presented in this paper can provide a feasible way of controlling the nonlinear UVMS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An underwater manipulator is a complex system, highly non-linear and subject to disturbances caused by underwater effects. To obtain a reliable system, robust control strategies have to be designed for the manipulator. The main contribution of this paper is the development of the low-level position/force control structure for an underwater manipulator. The proposed control strategy is planned in the operational space and combines together the parallel control structure for position/force applications with the sliding mode theory and the manipulator model information. The dynamic model of the system incorporates the hydrodynamic effects and an approximation of the end-effector force contact with the environment. This paper presents a method for computing the interaction force at the end-effector in the absence of a force–torque sensor. The control structure is validated through a Lyapunov-stability approach and experimental results. The control structure is tested on a 6 degrees-of-freedom underwater manipulator interacting with the underwater environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In underwater robotic interaction tasks (e.g., sampling of sea organisms, underwater welding, panel handling, etc) various issues regarding the uncertainties and complexity of the robot dynamic model, the external disturbances (e.g., sea currents), the steady state performance as well as the overshooting/undershooting of the interaction force error, should be addressed during the control design. Motivated by the aforementioned considerations, this paper presents a force/position tracking control protocol for an Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System (UVMS) in compliant contact with a planar surface, without incorporating any knowledge of the UVMS dynamic model, the exogenous disturbances or the contact stiffness model. Moreover, the proposed control framework guarantees: (i) certain predefined minimum speed of response, maximum steady state error as well as overshoot/undershoot concerning the force/position tracking errors, (ii) contact maintenance and (iii) bounded closed loop signals. Additionally, the achieved transient and steady state performance is solely determined by certain designer-specified performance functions/parameters and is fully decoupled from the control gain selection and the initial conditions. Finally, both simulation and experimental studies clarify the proposed method and verify its efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Last decade has seen a spurt in autonomous technologies in military and civilian sectors. The search for oil and gas is moving into ever deeper waters, and the need for coastal surveillance and climatic monitoring, makes underwater autonomous assistance quite obvious for a developing nation like India with thousands of kilometres of coastline. Using such platforms in these endeavours provides an efficient way to keep human life out of harm’s way in hostile environments. The prototype developed has its navigation based on an internal IMU (Inertial Mass Unit) and the software is extensible to support DVL (Doppler Velocity Logger) based navigation. Near range object detection and path planning is achieved via Image Processing and using two surge and one heave thrusters the bot can operate in three degrees of freedom. The modular structure allows for the addition of extra sensors like pressure, temperature and manipulators like grippers and torpedoes. It has a Intel Atom processor, which runs the control algorithms for motion and required task completion.},

abstract={Concentrating on the dynamic positioning of unmanned underwater vehicle in the presence of disturbances caused by working manipulators, a fuzzy switching sliding mode control method is adopted and enhanced by a dynamic normalization factor. Firstly, sliding mode control is used as the principal algorithm to guarantee the robustness and disturbance rejection ability. Secondly, a fuzzy inference engine is exploited to adjust the switching gains of the controller online, so that the switching gains are reduced and the control signals are smoothened without losing the robustness and the disturbance rejection ability. Finally, a dynamic normalization factor is introduced to normalize the input of the fuzzy inference engine to achieve a trade-off between sensitivity and stability. Simulation cases were performed along with comparisons with proportion–integration–differentiation controller and constant switching sliding mode controller. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and engineering realizability of the proposed approach.},

abstract={Underwater autonomous manipulation is a challenging task, which not only includes a complicated multibody dynamic and hydrodynamic process, but also involves the limited observation environment. This study systematically investigates the dynamic modeling and control of the underwater vehicle-manipulator multibody system. The dynamic model of underwater vehicle-manipulator system has been established on the basis of the Newton–Euler recursive algorithm. On the basis of dynamic analysis, a motion planning optimization algorithm has been designed in order to realize the coordinate motions between AUV and manipulator through reducing the restoring forces and saving the electric power. On the other hand, a disturbance force observer including the coupling and restoring forces has been designed. An observer-based dynamic control scheme has been established in combination with kinematic and dynamic controller. Furthermore., from the simulations, although the disturbance forces such as restoring and coupling forces are time varying and great, the observer-based dynamic coordinate controller can maintain the AUV attitude stable during the manipulator swing and pitch motions. During the precise manipulation simulation, the stable AUV attitude and minimization of disturbance forces have been realized through combination of optimal motion planning and the observer-based dynamic coordinate controller. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={For the motion coordination problem between the underwater vehicle and manipulator of the underwater vehicle-manipulator system, a new redundancy resolution method is proposed and investigated. The proposed method mainly has two parts: a fuzzy logic part and a multitasks weighted gradient projection method part. The fuzzy logic part is used to decide the weight factors of the motion distribute matrix and the priorities of all the secondary objectives, while the multitasks weighted gradient projection method part is used to handle the secondary objectives with the weight factors and priorities decided by the fuzzy logic part. Moreover, a new secondary objective is proposed to optimize underwater vehicle-manipulator system’s attitude, which takes the payload into consideration. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed redundancy resolution is verified through some comparative simulations. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={To solve the trajectory tracking control problem of underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) under strong nonlinear couplings and complex parametric uncertainties and unknown external disturbance, a nonlinear robust control method based on time delay estimation (TDE) was proposed and investigated in this paper. The core idea of this method is that builds the basic architecture of the controller with TDE, and realizes the online estimation and real time compensation of the complex unknown lumped dynamics for the system. Afterwards, a designed desired dynamic equation is used to regulate the system control performance. Benefitting from the compensation of the unknown lumped dynamics and the model-free nature of TDE, the proposed method has good robustness and practical easy usage. Finally, the effective of the proposed method was demonstrated by comparative numerical simulations with a 9 degree of freedoms (DOFs) UVMS. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={A task-priority redundancy resolution with restoring moments optimized on acceleration level for the underwater vehicle-manipulator system is investigated in this article. Redundant resolution is a key and difficult problem in underwater vehicle-manipulator system’s trajectory planning. Firstly, kinematic modeling and dynamic modeling based on Lagrange method are studied. To overcome acceleration’s sudden change in traditional task-priority method, a new redundancy resolution method on the acceleration level is proposed. In this approach, a scalar potential function is established and used for reducing the effect of restoring moments by applying gradient projection. Finally, simulation is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing with traditional approaches. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={In various interaction tasks using Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems (UVMSs) (e.g. sampling of the sea organisms, underwater welding), important factors such as: i) uncertainties and complexity of UVMS dynamic model ii) external disturbances (e.g. sea currents and waves) iii) imperfection and noises of measuring sensors iv) steady state performance as well as v) inferior overshoot of interaction force error, should be addressed during the force control design. Motivated by the above factors, this paper presents a model-free control protocol for force controlling of an Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System which is in contact with an unknown compliant environment, without incorporating any knowledge of the UVMS's dynamic model, exogenous disturbances and sensor's noise model. Moreover, the transient and steady state response as well as reduction of overshooting force error are solely determined by certain designer-specified performance functions and are fully decoupled by the UVMS's dynamic model, the control gain selection, as well as the initial conditions. Finally, a simulation study clarifies the proposed method and verifies its efficiency. © 2017},

abstract={A hybrid impedance control scheme for the force and position control of an end-effector is presented in this paper. The interaction of the end-effector is controlled using a passive foundation with compensation gain. For obtaining the steady state, a proportional-integral-derivative controller is tuned with an impedance controller. The hybrid impedance controller is implemented on a terrestrial (ground) single-arm robot manipulator. The modeling is done by creating a bond graph model and efficacy is substantiated through simulation results. Further, the hybrid impedance control scheme is applied on a two-link flexible arm underwater robot manipulator for welding applications. Underwater conditions, such as hydrodynamic forces, buoyancy forces, and other disturbances, are considered in the modeling. During interaction, the minimum distance from the virtual wall is maintained. A simulation study is carried out, which reveals some effective stability of the system. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={is paper addresses a task-space trajectory control of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) employed for interactive underwater tasks. .e robust task-space tracking control is achieved by designing a non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC) with disturbance estimator and demonstrated on a planar underwater vehicle with serial two link manipulator arm a.ached to it. .e proposed NFTSMC integrates a non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC) with a non-linear disturbance observer. This combination not only assures €nite and faster convergence of the systems states to the equilibrium from anywhere in the phase-plane but also overcomes the problem of singularity associated with conventional terminal sliding mode controller (TSMC). In addition to this, because of the disturbance observer augmented in the proposed control law, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is enhanced to a great extent. .e feasibility of the proposed NFTSMC is con€rmed by performing extensive numerical simulation on the UVMS for tracking a given pre-de€ned task space trajectory under the in.uence of parameter uncertainties, ocean current and measurement sensor noises.},

abstract={The motion of manipulator will cause a certain influence while underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS) hovering, to reduce the impacts, a model based coordinate motion control method was proposed based on the unique system structure like SY-II UVMS. According to Newton-Eulerian recursive algorithm, the disturbances model which consisted of coupling impacts and restoring force (moment) generated by the motion of the manipulator were obtained, and then the global kinematic control loop with dynamic control law based on disturbances model was combined to compensate the disturbances that affected the vehicle's attitude. Experiments carried on SY-II UVMS show that compared with S surface control, the proposed control method basically keeps the station stable showing its superiority by estimating and compensating positon error in real time. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

abstract={SUMMARY As various robots are anticipated to coexist with humans in the near future, safe manipulation in unknown, cluttered environments becomes an important issue. Manipulation in an unknown environment, however, has been proven to be NP-Hard and the risk of unexpected human - robot collision hampers the dawning of the era of human - robot coexistence. We propose a non-contact-based sensitive skin as a means to provide safe manipulation hardware and interleaving planning between the workspace and the configuration space as software to solve manipulation problems in unknown, crowded environments. Novelty of the paper resides in demonstration of real time and yet complete path planning in an uncertain and crowded environment. To that end, we introduce the framework of the sensor-based interleaving planner (SBIP) whereby search completeness and safe manipulation are both guaranteed in cluttered environments. We study an interleaving mechanism between sensation in a workspace and execution in the corresponding configuration space for real-time planning in uncertain environments, thus the name interleaving planner implies. Applications of the proposed system include manipulators of a humanoid robot, surgical manipulators, and robotic manipulators working in hazardous and uncertain environments such as underwater, unexplored planets, and unstructured indoor spaces. © Cambridge University Press 2016.},

abstract={This paper presents a new technique for exploration and mapping/surveying of underwater infrastructure and/or objects of interest, using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed method employs rotational potential fields, and extends them for use on multiple vehicles within a three dimensional environment. An inter-vehicle fluid formation is maintained throughout, free of angular constraints (or the need of a virtual vehicle). When an object of interest is approached, the formation is split and follows a smooth trajectory around opposite sides of its boundary. To fully utilise the potential of rotational fields, a unique local 2D-plane is created around every object within the 3D environment, which is employed for boundary coverage. Traditional artificial potential fields are used to guide vehicles towards each object in turn (and maintain the fluid formation), while rotational fields are employed within the local 2D-plane providing a smooth trajectory around opposing sides of every object. Simulation results show the method to be effective, providing a more stable trajectory. Comparison with the standard technique shows that the formation is maintained throughout and overall journey time is significantly reduced using this method. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) is a useful system to perform diverse and sophisticated operations under the water. However it is difficult to control the motion of UVMS due to external disturbances such as payloads holding underwater objects, currents, etc. In this paper, in order to ensure the dynamic stability of the UVMS, redundancy resolution method is proposed using a zero moment point (ZMP) algorithm. In order to evaluate the proposed ZMP algorithm and redundancy resolution method, a testbed composed of redundant manipulator was developed. The results show that ZMP algorithm helps the stability of the UVMS while the end-effector of the manipulator tracks the desired trajectory accurately. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a practical design method for the robust control of a class of MIMO nonlinear plants operating under model uncertainties and matched disturbances where the only available information for feedback are the outputs of the plant. A neural networks based dynamic integral sliding mode control (NNDISMC) with output differentiator observer is developed for the considered class. This NNDISMC approach utilizes the robust output differentiation observer for the higher derivative estimation and neural networks to estimate the nonlinear functions which are assumed unknown. Having estimated the unknown derivatives and uncertain functions, an integral manifold based on the estimated states is designed and a control law is proposed which confirms the sliding mode enforcement across the designed integral manifold from the very start of the process. The overall robustness of the controller is guaranteed by using the neural networks, differentiator observer and dynamic integral control law in a closed loop. The closed loop stability analysis is presented in detail, and the asymptotic convergence of the system states to the equilibrium is confirmed. The proposed method is very practical and plays a very significant role in the robust control of electromechanical systems, such as robotic manipulators, unmanned air vehicles and underwater vehicles. The simulation results on a robotic manipulator are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper develops a virtual platform of an underwater manipulator mounted on a submersible vehicle via the three-dimensional simulator 'Webots' for teleoperation through a replica master arm. The graphical, kinematic, and dynamic models of the manipulator refer to a master-slave servo hydraulic manipulator with seven functions, consisting of six degrees of freedom and a parallel gripper, while the 'Jiaolong' deep-manned submersible vehicle, operating below the sea surface down to 7000 m, is chosen as the underwater manipulator carrier. This study uses the virtual platform for training an operator to telepresence control the virtual manipulator to complete basic tasks in subsea environments. When training the operator, one has to consider uncertain external disturbances and the visual impacts that stem from subsea environments. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual platform, one designs two typical underwater operational tasks: Grasping a marine organism sample and reaching at a given position. This paper presents the comparative studies: 1) the performances demonstrated by remotely controlling the virtual manipulator and the real manipulator; 2) the operating performances delivered by three operators before and after training when using the platform. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={It is extremely difficult to operate an underwater manipulator carried on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the deep sea. In order to investigate underwater manipulator operations maneuvered by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), this paper develops a virtual underwater manipulator and its carrier, the ROV, via the three-dimensional simulator “Webots” to animate operational tasks. The ROV model refers to the structure of a typical ROV which operates below the ocean's surface down to 1000 m, while the graphical and kinematic models of the manipulator refer to a master-slave servo hydraulic manipulator with 7 functions, consisting of six degrees of freedom (DOFs) and a parallel gripper for manipulations. This study uses the virtual platform to challenge an operator to conduct different tasks by using the manipulator, including two switch-based and one master arm-based operation, and combined by remote and autonomous operations. When conducting the operations, we have considered uncertain external disturbances that stem from subsea environments. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual platform, we have designed two typical underwater operational tasks for training the operator: grasping a machine part in a basket, and making a circle at a specified position on the seabed. The tasks are completed by coordinating the underwater manipulator, the submersible vehicle, and a pan-tilt camera. Three operators were invited for the training operations, and their operating results are presented. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents, a robust nonlinear proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-like fuzzy control scheme for a task-space trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (AUVMS) employed for deep-sea intervention tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is numerically demonstrated on a planar underwater vehicle manipulator system (consisting of an underwater vehicle and two link rotary (2R) serial planar manipulator). The actuator and sensor dynamics of the system are also incorporated in the dynamical model of an AUVMS. The proposed control law consists of two main parts: first part uses a feed forward term to reinforce the control activity with extravagance from known desired acceleration vector and carries an estimated perturbed term to compensate for the unknown effects namely external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics and the second part uses a PID-like fuzzy logic control as a feedback portion to enhance the overall closed-loop stability of the system. The primary objective of the proposed control scheme is to track the given end-effector task-space trajectory despite of external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises associated with the AUVMS system. To show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, comparison is made with linear and nonlinear PID controllers. Simulation results confirmed that with the proposed control scheme, the AUVMS can successfully track the given desired spatial trajectory and gives better and robust control performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Efficiency and accuracy could be improved by greater degree of automation in underwater tasks operating. However, there is a prerequisite that the manipulator should have a desired end-effector trajectory and suitable force applied to the environment to avoid the possibility of damage to the manipulator, object, or both. To reduce position and orientation deviation of the end-effector of a 7-function underwater electric manipulator, caused by the joints angle control error, an online adjustment algorithm based on force sensing for the autonomous trajectory planning is researched. The end-effector position and orientation deviation become smaller than the offline planning without force sensing when using same controller to operate the manipulator system. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been emphatically compared and verified through simulation experiments in this paper, and the results are reported in detail. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a control design method with a new nonlinear disturbance observer using delayed estimates for motion control of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). In recent years, application of an underwater vehicle has been expected in various fields. Since modeling unknown hydrodynamic forces is difficult, nonlinear disturbance observers have been proposed in the aim of decreasing disturbances due to hydrodynamic forces. In this paper, we propose a new disturbance observer by combining a conventional disturbance observer and time delay control, and attempt to apply it to motion control of a UVMS. Further, an analysis of ultimate boundedness and numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed control system. The respective analysis and simulation results show that the proposed disturbance observer exhibits faster convergence and less estimation errors than the conventional one and hence the control system based on it can perform successful motion control. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The dynamic model and coordinate motion trajectory optimization have been investigated on unmanned underwater vehicle and manipulator system. Based on the kinematic model of underwater vehicle and manipulator system, the dynamic model has been obtained using the Newton-Eulerian recursive algorithm, and the restoring and coupling reaction forces have been systematically analyzed. Furthermore, a motion trajectory optimization algorithm has been designed in combination with primal-dual optimization and the genetic algorithm based on dynamic analysis. Simulations results display that the pitch and swing of manipulator has a great effect on the vehicle. Restoring forces have been greatly reduced by the optimization algorithm. Therefore, more thrust force will be available for oceanic disturbance. The comparison results illustrate that the genetic algorithm outperforms the particle swarm optimization algorithm in trajectory optimization. © 2016, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press.

abstract={The response of the ROGUE underwater glider controlled by a scheme called Sliding PD control is shown and described. This control law has been widely used in robot manipulators, quadrotors and underwater ROV's. This is a model-free and chattering-free controller that makes motion robust to disturbance and uncertainty. The ROGUE dynamic model calculated on the vertical plane take into account a ballast tank fixed at the buoyancy center, a movable mass capable of motion just along the longitudinal axis and eliminates the offset static point mass. These considerations simplify significantly the equations of motion. Through simulation results this nonlinear controller demonstrates that it ensures a steady glide by directly controlling the movable mass position along with the ballast mass. © 2015 MTS.},

abstract={Hydraulic system is widely used in industry where large actuation forces are needed such as electro-hydraulic positioning system, active suspension control, and so on. One of the main problem in hydraulic system is the nontriviality, for instance, the deadbands in valve operation, frictions of links, saturations, pressure dynamics, etc. both system unknown nonlinearities and external disturbances should be considered in controller design. For underwater hydraulic manipulator, because of the environment of sea and the large nonlinearities of the hydraulic manipulator system, both system unknown nonlinearities and external disturbances should be considered in controller design. A lot of control methods have been proposed to solve the problem properly, such as sliding mode control, adaptive control, fuzzy adaptive control, adaptive robust control, ect. However, due to limited knowledge about hydraulic manipulator system, it is hard to precisely estimate the nonlinearities for a possible higher performance. In this paper, a neural network adaptive robust control method is proposed to help control an underwater hydraulic manipulator. In order to achieve better performance using adaptive robust control strategy, unknown nonlinearities in the system are approximated by the outputs of radial basis function neural network (RBFNNs). A projection law has been used to bound the NN weights when they are tuning on-line to avoid possible adaptive divergence, and the tracking transient performance is guaranteed by robust control law. Simulation results illustrate that manipulator has a good tracking performance. © 2015 MTS.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the two dimensional fluidstructure interaction problem of the oscillation of a shapemorphing plate in a quiescent, Newtonian, viscous fluid. The plate is considered as a moving wall for the fluid undergoing two concurrent periodic motions: a rigid oscillation along its transverse direction coupled to a shape-morphing deformation to an arc of a circle with prescribed maximum curvature. Differently from studies concerned with passive flexible structures, here, we introduce the prescribed deformation to specifically manipulate vortex-shedding and modulate hydrodynamic forces and energy losses during underwater oscillations. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed to evaluate the effect of the prescribed deformation strategy on the added mass and damping effect along with the hydrodynamic power dissipation. We observe that a minimum in the hydrodynamic power dissipation exists for an optimum curvature of the plate. This finding may allow significant power expenditure reduction in underwater vibrating systems where minimization of energy losses or maximization of quality factor are desirable.

abstract={The operation of autonomous underwater vehicles is often hindered by their battery capacity, limiting the duration of its use. Here, we propose an integrated solution for autonomous charging of a robotic fish via direct contact through a novel claw mechanism for docking guidance. To assist the robotic fish in the docking process, the system incorporates a charging station designed with form-fit claws. A controller is designed to monitor the battery level of the robotic fish during free swimming and coordinate the docking process with respect to the maneuvers of both the robot and form-fit claws. Upon recognizing a low battery level, the controller commands the robotic fish to begin the docking process, and video feedback from an overhead camera is used to inform the autonomous navigation toward the charging station. After reaching a battery level threshold, the robotic fish is then released back in the water and returns to free swimming until the battery is discharged again. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the possibility of prolonged operation, consisting of repeated cycles of autonomous charging. Our proposed charging method enables prolonged autonomous swimming with minimal human supervision, opening the door for new, transformative applications of robotic fish in laboratory research and field deployment.

abstract={Research in animal behavior has benefited from the availability of robots able to elicit controllable, customizable, and versatile stimuli in behavioral studies. For example, biologically-inspired robotic fish can be designed to mimic the morphophysiology of predators and conspecifics to study fear response and sociality. However, size is a critical limitation of the existing arrays of robotic fish. Here, we present the design of a miniature robotic fish for future animal-robot interaction studies featuring a novel application of multi-material three-dimensional (3D) printing and utilizing a solenoid for actuation. The use of multi-material printing enables a skeletal design of only two parts, while retaining the complete functionality of larger prototypes enclosing requisite electronics and incorporating an active joint for propulsion. Parametric tests are conducted to test the swimming speed of the robotic fish and a compact dynamic model with two degrees of freedom to elucidate swimming of the robotic fish is presented.

abstract={This paper describes modeling of the inverse kinematics of a 6-DOF underwater manipulator using closed form solution approach. The manipulator structure is based on puma 560 robot with some modification. The manipulator is aimed for underwater operation in water pool. Robotic manipulator is positioning device and its end-effector is required to move in a particular way to accomplish a specific task. The major problem with manipulator is of motion or trajectory planning and its control because execution of any task needs the manipulator to follow a preplanned path. Purpose of trajectory planning is to describe the required motion of the manipulator as a time sequence of locations of joints, links and end-effector and derivatives of their locations. Inverse kinematics solutions can be divided as analytical and numerical. Analytical solutions are preferred because these yield complete computationally fast and reliable solutions. We developed a fast inverse kinematics algorithm with a closed-form solution for a 6-DOF underwater manipulator. The developed algorithm is validated using simulation in Robotic toolbox. Inverse kinematics is calculated and simulation of end effector is done for given joint and link parameters. Finally graphs for motion of manipulator as a time sequence of joints and links are obtained. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={A hovering control design based on back-stepping method is proposed for a dynamic model of an underwater robot with tilting thrusters. In order to achieve various underwater tasks, a robotic platform must be able to maintain its position and orientation against ocean currents and reaction forces from the manipulator's operation. The underwater robot which has four tilting thrusters can carry out six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) motion. A dynamic model is derived for the underwater robot based on hydrodynamic analysis and nonlinear thrust vector mapping. A hovering controller based on a dynamic model is derived by using a back-stepping control method, and disturbance models, such as ocean currents and reaction from the attached manipulator, are designed. Simulations show reasonable results of the control system under disturbance. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We introduce a new underwater robotic platform with a tilting thruster mechanism for hovering motion. The tilting thruster mechanism can implement six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion with only four thrusters, but tilting motion makes the system nonlinear. We designed a selective switching controller in order to solve the nonlinear problem, and applied it to the robot system. The selective switching controller divides the six-DOF system into two three-DOF subsystems, and switches between subcontrollers according to the error in real time. Dynamic models of a robotic platform and a disturbance model of an attached manipulator are derived for the control design. Using simulation, the stability condition of control is determined, and the validity of the derived dynamic model of the robotic platform and manipulator is verified through comparison between simulation and experiment. A hovering experiment under a disturbance from the manipulator is performed to verify the robustness of the controller. The experimental results validate the successful hovering ability of the proposed robot. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the present work, a method based on belief space planning, assuming maximum likelihood of the observations, is applied to the planning of manipulation for an underwater robotic arm. The manipulator is rigidly connected to a floating platform, such as a ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) or an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). The arm and platform motions are statistically independent from the motion of the object to be grasped. The belief space planning strategy allows to plan the reaching movement with the objectives of concurrently reducing the end-effector distance from the target and the uncertainty on the measure. In this paper the implementation of belief space planning assuming maximun observation likelihood is reported and is applied to an industrial class of underwater arm modelled as purely deterministic. Results obtained by the proposed strategy within preliminary experiments in air are here provided. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The paper describes a novel cooperative control policy for the transportation of large objects in underwater environments using two UVMS (Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems). Due to the low bandwidth available in underwater scenarios, the main feature of the paper lies in the fact that the cooperative transportation of the commonly grasped object is carried out successfully by just exchanging the tool frame velocities at each sampling instant. A disturbance compensation technique is also presented to cope with sea currents and vehicle velocity tracking errors. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a robust nonlinear control scheme for task-space trajectory control for an autonomous underwater vehicle- manipulator system (AUVMS) based on an improved proportional integral derivative (PID) control scheme used for deep-sea intervention tasks. A planar underwater vehicle manipulator system (consists of an underwater vehicle and two link rotary (2R) serial planar manipulator) with dynamic coupling between them is considered for the study and numerical simulation. The actuator and sensor dynamics of the system are also considered. The proposed controller integrates the known approximated inverse dynamic model output as a model-base portion of the controller; uses a feed forward term to enhance the control activity with indulgence from known desired acceleration vector; carries an estimated perturbed term to compensate for the unknown effects namely external disturbances and un-modelled dynamics and a decoupled nonlinear PID controller as a feedback portion to enhance closed-loop stability and account for the estimation error of uncertainties. The primary objective of the proposed control scheme is to track the given end-effector task-space trajectory despite of external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises associated with the AUVMS system, which show the robustness of the proposed control scheme. Simulation results confirmed that the AUVMS can successfully track the given desired spatial trajectory. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This article investigates a new robust nonlinear proportional integral derivative (PID) position tracking control applied on a serial underwater spatial manipulator with three degrees of freedom. The proposed controller integrates the known approximated inverse dynamic model output as a model-base portion of the controller. It uses a feed forward term to enhance the control activity with indulgence from known desired acceleration vector. The proposed control scheme carries an estimated perturbed term to compensate for the unknown effects namely external disturbances and unmodelled dynamics. Finally, it has a decoupled nonlinear PID controller as a feedback portion to enhance closed-loop stability and account for the estimation error of uncertainties. The usefulness and competency of the proposed approach are demonstrated with the help of numerical simulations. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Abstract An improved Time Delay Control (TDC) method for an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) is proposed. The proposed controller consists of three terms: a time-delay-estimation term that cancels nonlinearities of the UVMS dynamics, a Terminal Sliding Mode (TSM) term that provides a fast response and a PID term that reduces the tracking error. In addition the proposed controller uses fuzzy rules to adaptively tune the gains of TDC and PID terms. A full dynamic of UVMS is presented and some simulation studies are done. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. The proposed controller not only provides the high performance in trajectory tracking, but it also has an acceptable robustness in presence of the external disturbance and unknown forces/torques in comparison with conventional sliding mode controller. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

An inverse dynamic solution for the system is obtained using the Newton-Euler method incorporating hydrodynamic and dynamic coupling effects.

abstract={This paper presents a coordinated motion control scheme using a disturbance observer in task space for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). Since, the UVMS is kinematically redundant in nature, the proposed controller permits self-motion which can be utilized to perform power efficient trajectory tracking and at the same time it also assures that the system is able to track the given desired spatial trajectory with minimal errors (despite the presence of external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises). The performance of the proposed coordinated motion control of the UVMS is demonstrated numerically by simulating a few underwater tasks such as payload conveyance. The system's disturbance compensation capabilities are shown and the effects of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties on the station keeping performance are also analyzed. A comparative analysis on power consumption is presented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The underwater stationary intervention object is moving relatively to underwater manipulator base when underwater vehicle is hovering. To realize the relative dynamic object operation, cubic B-spline is used in manipulator trajectory planning. This paper provides maximum interval of two adjacent control points to adjust the control points near dynamic object to generate smooth trajectory in real time. The approximate minimum time trajectory is achieved by setting maximum adjacent control points' interval. Gradient Projection Method (GPM) with new function scalar is introduced to optimize the trajectory in joint space when manipulator is tracking the dynamic trajectory in Cartesian space. Trajectory planning and tracking simulation for a fixed base 6-DOF underwater manipulator is presented in the last. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The paper investigates a path planning and following algorithm of observing targets for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system(UVMS). The algorithm including the operational task assignment and path following for the UVMS is proposed. The operational task assignment consists of path planning and task assignment. Path planning provides planned trajectory distance between any two targets for task assignment, and task assignment produces a suitable task order for the minimum of the UVMS sailing distance. In path planning, the shortest path considering UVMS nonholonomic constraints - Dubins curve, is employed. It is implemented by matrix transformation. Then a digraph is generated by marking the shortest distance between any two targets. Hence the task assignment problem is considered as a traveling salesman problem, which can be achieved by the genetic algorithm. Finally a path-following guidance method is employed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper deals with a control scheme for underwater vehicle-manipulator systems with the dynamics of thrusters in the presence of uncertainties in its system parameters and bounded disturbances. The authors have developed a robust controller that overcomes thruster nonlinearities, which cause an uncontrollable system. However, the controller has disadvantages in its performances (e.g., steady-state errors). In this paper we develop a robust controller with a fixed compensator including an integral action. The objective of the compensator is to improve the performances of the controller. The ultimate boundedness of a tracking error is theoretically ensured in the control system. Furthermore, simulation results support the theoretical one. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In this work, a novel local motion planning algorithm is presented, for underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS) that perform autonomous underwater inspection operations. An optimization problem is formulated considering the collision avoidance, the approximation of the given task curve and critical optimization criteria. The searching method is based on an evolutionary algorithm and it is able to generate a local motion plan using continuously updated sensor information. The working environment is represented by a Bump-surface entity, constantly updated by a parallel algorithm implemented on a graphical processing unit (GPU). A trained artificial neural network is used for the fast approximation of the considered dexterity index. The local planner can cope with unknown obstacles inside the workspace while executing the task and pursuing high performance configurations in the free space. A welding inspection on an underwater tube structure is considered as the validation scenario, while a UVMS with a mounted six degrees of freedom manipulator is assigned to perform the task. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={This paper presents a study of the interaction effects between a lightweight underwater vehicle and the attached manipulator. Based on a tree representation of the system, the dynamic and hydrodynamic model of the UVMS is computed and the coupling effects are analysed. Simulations show that having a manipulator with considerable mass compared with the vehicle significantly influences the stability of the system. Gaining a clear understanding of the coupling effects is important for designing the control laws. Moreover, it is possible that incorporating these disturbances in the control methods can improve the performance of the UVMS. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Autonomous robots are not very good at being autonomous. They work well in structured environments, but fail quickly in the real world facing uncertainty and dynamically changing conditions. In this chapter, we describe robot learning approaches that help to elevate robot autonomy to the next level, the so-called ‘persistent autonomy’. For a robot to be ‘persistently autonomous’ means to be able to perform missions over extended time periods (e.g. days or months) in dynamic, uncertain environments without need for human assistance. In particular, persistent autonomy is extremely important for robots in difficult-to-reach environments such as underwater, rescue, and space robotics. There are many facets of persistent autonomy, such as: coping with uncertainty, reacting to changing conditions, disturbance rejection, fault tolerance, energy efficiency and so on. This chapter presents a collection of robot learning approaches that addressmany of these facets. Experimentswith robot manipulators and autonomous underwater vehicles demonstrate the usefulness of these learning approaches in real world scenarios. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={For an underwater vehicle-manipulator system, which consists of an underwater vehicle equipped with a manipulator, it is important to regulate the position of the manipulators end-effector with respect to a given target position in many interactive operations. This paper presents a task space-based approach for designing a controller that ensures that the end-effector of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system maintains its position in the presence of unknown ocean currents and uncertainties without the explicit use of a disturbance observer. A feedback linearizing control in task coordinates is used, and an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed as a state observer. The proposed approach can also be applied to dynamic positioning or controlled weathervaning of a surface ship whose motion is affected by environmental disturbances. To demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach, numerical simulations and experimental tests were carried out and their results are shown. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={7-Function underwater hydraulic manipulator can be mounted on underwater vehicles such as ROVs to achieve underwater operation. When the underwater vehicle is hovering in the sea, the target is in dynamic motion state compared to the vehicle position, which makes difficult for operators to accomplish dynamic operation task. Based on the underwater hydraulic manipulator structure characteristics, joint angle, joint angular velocity and total flow constraints are analyzed for manipulator trajectory generation. Cubic B-spline is applied to generate joint trajectories. To generate dynamic target trajectories, a method that can modify control points by calculating adjacent control points' intervals to fit the dynamic target is proposed. It can easily achieve synchronization and does not need to determine the total execution time before operation. Simulation experiments are performed to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper addresses the issue of developing a robust and efficient controller for a manipulator for underwater applications by proposing a terminal sliding mode control scheme along with a disturbance observer and incorporating the same for 3-RRR serial spatial manipulator to ensure finite time convergence as asymptotic convergence in undesirable in underwater tasks like positioning and tracking of a trajectory. The performance of the proposed scheme is studied using extensive numerical simulations depicting practical circumstances with external disturbances and parameter uncertainties within the system. The capability of the control scheme to overcome hydrodynamic forces and moments including added mass effects, damping effects are extensively studied and validated for the control scheme. The dynamic modelling is done using the Euler-Lagrangian approach involving the energy associated with the system. The results are presented after analyzing the trajectory tracking capabilities of the manipulator in the presence of external disturbances and model uncertainties. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Design of an accurate and robust controller is a challenging topic in an underwater manipulator control. This is due to hydrodynamic disturbances in underwater environment. In this paper a sliding mode control (SMC) included a PID sliding surface and fuzzy tunable gain is designed. In this proposed controller robustness property of SMC and fast response of PID are incorporated with fuzzy rules to reduce error tracking. In the control law, for removing of chattering, the exponential function is used. And also the system is analyzed in terms of stability by direct Lyapunov method. By tuning gains with fuzzy logic, the proposed controller does not require an accurate model of underwater manipulator dynamics. Hence the modeling and simulation studies are done for an underwater manipulator to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in presence of unmodeled dynamic (variable masses of links) and external disturbance. Both new proposed controller and conventional SMC are simulated. The results of simulation show the high performance of proposed controller in comparison to conventional SMC. © 2003-2012 Latin American Applied Research Journal.},

abstract={This paper represents a new underwater robotic platform with four tilting thrusters for hovering motion. The tilting mechanism can implement the six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) motion with only four thrusters but causes an increase in the nonlinearity of thrust force vector map. In order to overcome the nonlinearity, the selective switching controller is designed, and applied it to the robot system. The selective switching controller chooses each three-DOF sub-controller according to the error in real-time. The experiment, which a robot maintains the position and orientation under a disturbance from an attached manipulator, is performed in a water tank. The results verify the hovering ability of the robot. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes the design and implementation of a robust position tracking control scheme for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The proposed controller does not require knowledge of the vehicle's dynamic parameters and guarantees prescribed transient and steady state performance despite the presence of external disturbances acting on the vehicle. The resulting scheme is of low complexity and computational cost and thus can be easily integrated to an embedded control platform of an AUV. The proposed control scheme has analytically guaranteed stability and convergence properties, while its applicability and performance are experimentally verified using the Girona500 AUV into two different missions: a) navigation and stabilization to a specific configuration, b) meandrus-like trajectory tracking. In both cases the vehicle was under the influence of time-varying external disturbances caused by a high-pressure water jet installed on the Girona500 manipulator. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This study addresses the detailed modeling and simulation of the dynamic coupling between an underwater vehicle and manipulator system. The dynamic coupling effects due to damping, restoring, and inertial effects of an underwater manipulator mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) are analyzed by considering the actuator and sensor characteristics. A model reference control (MRC) scheme is proposed for the underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated using numerical simulations along with comparative study between conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The robustness of the proposed control scheme is also illustrated in the presence of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. © 2013 Mohan Santhakumar.},

abstract={This paper proposes a general framework to control underwater vehicle-manipulator systems from external sensors. The design of the control law follows several constraints and criteria to optimize the overall behavior. The task is defined in the sensor space, that is suited for visual servoing from camera or sonar images. The control input distribution between the arm and the body is considered and separated between the approach and the intervention phases. The proposed framework is validated in a realistic simulation environment, imposing constant and varying disturbances at the velocity level. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a method for global motion planning of underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS). The algorithm can derive a feasible path for UVMS equipped with an n-degree of freedom manipulator for performing autonomous underwater operations. The environment of the system is represented by a 4D Bump-surface that is used for obstacle avoidance. To improve the performance of the proposed method, the parallel calculation of the obstacle avoidance algorithm is considered, leading to a 46-230 times faster implementation using a Graphics Processing Unit. A path following task in an environment cluttered with obstacles is considered for the validation of the method, while a UVMS with a mounted 6-dof manipulator performs the task. Both parallel and serial approaches are evaluated and discussed. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a new tracking control scheme for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). The proposed task space passivity based controller is not only used to track the given desired path but also allows the use of the self-motion of the vehicle to perform power efficient trajectory because of its kinematically redundant nature. In the proposed scheme, the primary task is to track the given end-effector task space trajectory despite of the system associated with external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises. The secondary task as the energy savings requirement, the vehicle motion is controlled and to be aligned with the estimated underwater current orientation. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed coordinated control motion of the UVMS is demonstrated numerically and confirmed with the specified UVMS tasks. Simulation results show that the required control inputs for the given tracking task are reduced, and the UVMS can successfully track the given desired spatial trajectory.},

abstract={A new nonlinear disturbance observer-based tracking control scheme for an underwater manipulator is presented in this paper. This observer overcomes the disadvantages of existing disturbance observers, which are designed or analyzed by the linear system techniques. It can be applied in underwater manipulator systems for various purposes such as payload compensation, interaction effects compensation, underwater current or external disturbance compensation, and independent system control.

abstract={This paper reports the development of a robotic inspection system using a mechanical contact mechanism that enhances the positioning stability of a small and lightweight underwater robot to take clear images of underwater targets and to work with manipulators for inspections under external disturbances. As described in this paper, first we perform a two-dimensional numerical analysis based on force and moment acting on an underwater robot with a contact mechanism. Second, we experimentally investigate the friction coefficients of several soft and high friction materials for the contact points of a prototype contact mechanism to enhance the positioning stability of the robot. Based on the results of numerical analysis and the experimental investigation, we design and develop a prototype contact mechanism for an underwater robot. Moreover, we experimentally test the stability of the underwater robot with the contact mechanism in a test tank. Finally, a ship hull inspection is conducted as a field test in a port using the robot with the developed contact mechanism. The experimentally obtained results indicate that the proposed contact mechanism is a useful tool for underwater visual inspections and manipulator tasks of a small and lightweight underwater robot. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The manipulation in singular regions generates an instantaneous reduction in the mechanism mobility which can result in some disturbances in the trajectory tracking. In proximity of the singularities, small velocities in the end-effectors generates high speeds in the joints due to the gradual reduction of the mobility. The phenomenon of kinematic singularity generates a instantaneous instability in torque profile of the redundant robotic systems by the transformation of secondary joints to primary joints. The disturbances of the underwater environment intensifies the effects of the kinematic singularities because the hydrodynamic strongly oppose to torque variations. This work presents a methodology for using dual quaternions in the posture feedback of a Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) using the Davies method which avoids kinematic singularities and ensures the optimal torque profiles. © 2013 Springer Basel.},

abstract={An accurate dynamic model is important for both controller design and mission simulation, regardless of the control strategy employed. In this paper, a dynamic model for a 3500m underwater manipulator in flow disturbance is established based on Morison method. The technique provides a direct method for incorporating external environmental forces into the model. Applying the superposition principle, the hydraulic forces are decomposed into two parts, one is in static water condition and the other is in sea current condition. Through numerical calculation of hydrodynamics, the contribution of hydraulic resistance, buoyancy, sea steady flows and unsteady flows to manipulator's dynamic are analyzed in sort. It offers a reliable basis for this 3-DOF manipulator controller design. The model derived is a closed form solution which can be utilized in modern model-based control schemes. The underwater test results verify the performance of controller in flow disturbance. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract={This paper describes an underwater 300m micro underwater work tool-MUWT(named huwt-3E, stands for three functions micro electric manipulator in China). The working principle and components of multi-sensors are introduced in detail. The pressure-compensated joint is compact designed and integrated of a micro permanent magnet (PM) brushless motor, a drive circuit, and an angular feedback potentiometer. The underwater control system is based network and consisted of three embedded system are used for servo control, task plan and target sensor respectively. Considering variable payload and uncertainty of model, a sliding mode control scheme is proposed to realize a MUWT with high precision. The control principle is based on the exponential approach law and a saturation function is introduced to solve the problem of chattering. A novel and simple self-adaptive regulation method is used to improve the velocity of approaching. Under the constant load and variable load, the simulation results of trajectory tracking show the effectiveness of the improved controller. The underwater test results verify the performance of controller in flow disturbance. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract={This paper describes a new motion control and auto-grasp scheme for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system-AUVMS, which comprises of a 6 DOF vehicle and a 3 DOF electric-manipulator considering inherent kinematic redundancy under the hydrodynamic forces. Different from traditional methods, a sliding mode controller was designed to implement the control of the trajectory tracking of the manipulator's end-effectors without the whole modeling of the AUVMS. A fuzzy regulator was added to obtain the best response characteristic of the system and avoid the significant high frequency chattering. The numerical simulations are consistent with the above theoretical analysis. The electric underwater manipulator control system is based network and consisted of three embedded PC/104 computers which are used for servo control, task plan and target sensor respectively. Computer simulations are performed to verify the efficacy of the motion control scheme. An auto-grasp scheme of the deep ocean electric manipulator based multi-sensors is also presented. Underwater test results of coordinate motion control scheme confirm the fuzzy-sliding controller's ability to operate in a higher disturbance condition. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={While autonomous motion planning and control of ground based manipulators has received a lot of interest by researchers in the past three decades, autonomous operation of industrial underwater manipulators is not that well documented. The main bottlenecks in the autonomous operation of underwater manipulators is the dependance on factory supplied master-slave controllers and absence of precise, high speed computer based controllers. Recently, a computer based communication interface was presented in [1] for the industrial Orion7P manipulator from Schilling robotics. The present paper builds up on this computer interface and presents the application of existing and proven methods of autonomous motion planning and control from ground based manipulation to the underwater manipulation domain. Approaches for autonomous collision free path planning and trajectory following are presented for applications involving industrial standard underwater manipulators. These approaches are validated by experiments conducted on a real Orion7P manipulator. This paper thus presents a complete approach for autonomous collision free trajectory planning and execution for industrial underwater manipulators. © 2013 MTS.},

abstract={A passivity-based model-free control scheme for an underwater fully actuated vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) in contact tasks is proposed. Orthogonalized motion and force second-order sliding modes are enforced for all time for the redundant noninertial robotic UVMS, including when it is subject to a class of fluid disturbances. To this end, we first determine the constrained dynamics using the quasi-Lagrangian formulation to explicitly characterize hydrodynamic fluid perturbations. Our scheme aims at exploiting the structural properties of Lagrangian systems, then we derive a mapping between the quasi-Lagrangian UVMS to its equivalent Lagrangian form, and study the conditions for open-loop passivity preservation during the interaction of postures and contact constraints between the end effector of theUVMS and the rigid contact surface of bulky objects in cluttered submarine environments. Internal motions are simultaneously computed by solving, in the tangent subspace of the contact manifold, a hierarchy of secondary tasks to satisfy the posture constraints. More importantly, the solution shapes the extended errors that are used to preserve passivity and to enforce dissipativity so as to guarantee local exponential stability without any knowledge of the complex UVMS dynamics, and the energetic performance of the UVMS in closed-loop. Illustrative simulations are discussed to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Oil & Gas industry has seen increasing costs of finding and extracting hydrocarbons, especially in remote locations, ultra-deep water reservoirs (400 m or deeper) or in hostile environments. Those new exploration frontiers have been increasing the production complexity and logistic costs. In such conditions, oil exploration feasibility depends on new technologies to optimize production efficiency. One possible solution to this challenge is to increase the degree of automation in production units. New design concepts also consider the use of robotic devices in such scenarios. In this paper we present a robotics framework, SimUEP-Robotics (Robotics Simulator for Stationary Production Units - Unidades Estacionárias de Produção or UEPs, in Portuguese), aimed to enable planning the offshore platform robotizing using virtual reality techniques. The SimUEP-Robotics is based on ROS (Robot Operating System), a middleware for exchanging messages between different devices and processes that cooperate to accomplish a robotics task. SimUEP-Robotics is designed concerning the offshore requirements and is a flexible framework that allows the inclusion of new robots and devices in a virtual operation scenario. This capability enables the robotization and automation of offshore facilities that gradually evolve, starting from a complete virtual scenario towards a complete robotic system operating on a real platform, progressively including real devices. SimUEP-Robotics has an integrated Virtual Reality Engine (VR-Engine) specially tailored to provide realistic visualization of large offshore scene models in an immersive environment. The monitoring and management of remote operations of Stationary Production Units (SPU) is an activity that can also benefit by the usage of virtual reality scenarios due to the potential to reduce the complexity and difficulty in visualizing and validating simulations of operations performed by robots on a real SPU. The framework supports simultaneous simulation of multiple robots equipped with sensors and actuators like cameras, laser range finders and robotic manipulators. SimUEP-Robotics has also some specialized visualization tools like trajectory visualizer, ghostview robot animation, point-to-point measurement and a scenario editor that allows the user customize the target scenario accordingly. Through the use of those visualization tools it is possible, for example, to better understand the quality of the planned robot trajectory and propose new algorithms that can be further evaluated in the virtual environment. In conclusion, we argue that the validation process in an immersive virtual environment reduces risks and costs of real operation tests scenarios. SimUEP-Robotics has also an integrated Robotics-Simulator which is responsible for taking care of task planning and execution based on the information of the virtual scenario provided by the VR-Engine. To illustrate the effectiveness of the framework, different robotics applications were developed. One is an underwater application that calculates the whole dynamics of an operated ROV to simulate and test complex ROV operations in deep waters, like the connection of a flowline to a Christmas tree. The other one represents a topside offshore platform scenario where different virtual robots, derived from real mechanisms like Motoman D1A10, Puma 560, Seekur and others, operates. Results obtained on a pick and place task demonstrate the benefits of the proposed robotics framework for offshore applications. Copyright 2013, Offshore Technology Conference.},

abstract={The manipulation in singular regions promotes an instantaneous reduction in mechanism mobility, which can result in some disturbances in the trajectory tracking. In proximity to the singularities, small velocities of the end-effectors generate high speeds in the joints due to the gradual reduction of the mobility. The phenomenon of kinematic singularity promotes a instantaneous instability in torque profile of the redundant robotic systems by the transformation of secondary joints to primary joints. The disturbances of the underwater environment intensify the effects of the singularities because the hydrodynamic strongly oppose to torque variations. This work presents a methodology for using dual quaternions in the posture feedback of a Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) using the Davies method, which avoids kinematic singularities and ensures the optimal torque profiles. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper studies motion planning of underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) based on weighted minimum norm method with joint limit. In response to the problem that joint motion is limited and cannot give full play to kinematical performance in the range of allowed orientation angle, existed in the traditional weighted minimum norm method for joint limit, an improved method about motion planning is proposed. By means of introducing threshold in the joint potential function to change the initial position where the joint velocity is limited, the method makes that joint is only limited between threshold and boundary when it moves from the middle position to bilateral boundaries. A simulation is carried out to verify the proposed motion planning method. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper presents an indirect adaptive control method for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF). This method overcomes the disadvantages of existing disturbance observers and direct adaptive control schemes, which are based on linear system techniques and regressor-based techniques. The proposed control scheme can be applied to UVMSs for various purposes such as payload compensation, interaction effects compensation, underwater current or external disturbance compensation, reaction compensation, and independent system control. The performance of the proposed controller was demonstrated numerically by payload compensation, where it compensated for the reaction effects experienced during a manipulation task, and disturbance (underwater current) compensation in a UVMS with a six degrees of freedom (DOF) underwater vehicle and a 3-DOF underwater manipulator. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a tracking control scheme for an autonomous underwater-manipulator system (UVMS) where the proposed null space controller is not only used to track the given desired path but also allows the use of the self-motion of the vehicle to perform power efficient trajectory because of its kinematically redundant nature. In the proposed scheme, the primary task is to track the given end-effector task space trajectory despite of external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises. As the energy savings requirement, the vehicle motion is controlled to be aligned with the estimated ocean current orientation. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed coordinated control motion of the UVMS is demonstrated numerically and confirmed with the specified planar UVMS tasks. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work the problem of remote calibration and trajectory replanning for a subsea robotic manipulator is considered. Because the trajectory planning is normally done in a structured environment, several uncertainties arise when the robot is placed on the seabed and these need to be compensated for to guarantee that the task specifications are fulfilled. We address the particular problem of configuration errors in the robot base with respect to the configuration used during the off-line trajectory planning. A calibration method based on both internal and external sensors is presented in order to estimate the uncertainty in the location of the robot. Moreover, a trajectory replanning strategy in the Cartesian velocity space is proposed to guarantee that the originally planned trajectory is followed. Simulation and experiments performed with a 6-DoF robot manipulator and a real calibration grid show the viability of the proposed planning and control schemes. © 2012 IFAC.},

abstract={This work is focused on an underwater manipulator. To solve its nonlinear dynamics and hydrodynamics when it operates underwater, model reference adaptive control (MRAC) is applied. The output of the reference model represents the expected transient response. Adaptive controller parameters are adjusted on-line in real time according to the error between the reference model output and the system output and the outputs of the state filters, using an adaptive parameter regulator. The system control input is thus achieved such that the system output can track the reference model output. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme has accurate tracking ability and can greatly improve the dynamic and static properties of the system. The MRAC for the underwater manipulator is also fairly robust to load disturbance and system parameter variation. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper presents an intelligent controller for underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMS) based on the neuro-fuzzy approach. The controller is composed of fuzzy PD control with membership function tuning by linguistic hedge. A neural network compensator approximates the dynamics of the UVMS in decentralized form. The new controller has the advantages of simplicity of implementation due to decentralized design, precision, and robustness to payload variations and hydrodynamic disturbances. It has significantly low energy consumption compared to both the conventional PD and conventional fuzzy control methods. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated by results of simulations for a six degrees of freedom autonomous underwater vehicle with a three degrees of freedom on-board manipulator. © 2012 The Franklin Institute.},

abstract={This paper proposes an adaptive robust control scheme for an Underwater-Vehicle Manipulator System (UVMS). The proposed controller enables the tracking of the intersection of multiple local sub-regions that are assigned for each subsystem of a UVMS under the influence of modelling uncertainties as well as additive disturbances. The presence of variable ocean currents creates hydrodynamic forces and moments that are not well-known or predictable, even though they are bounded. Therefore, the control task of tracking a prescribed sub-region trajectory is challenging due to these additive bounded disturbances. In the presented adaptive control law, a least-squares estimation algorithm is utilized rather than gradient-type approach. The use of the self-motion due to the kinematically redundant system allows performance of multiple subtasks (e.g., maintaining manipulability and avoidance of mechanical joint limits). The asymptotically sub-region and sub-task tracking are ensured using the proposed control law despite the parametric uncertainty of the UVMS and external additive disturbances. The stability analysis is carried out using the Lyapunov-type approach. The simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract={This paper investigates the performance of a new robust tracking control on the basis of proportional-derivative observer-based backstepping control applied on a three degrees of freedom underwater spatial manipulator. Hydrodynamic forces and moments such as added mass effects, damping effects, and restoring effects can be large and have a significant effect on the dynamic performance of the underwater manipulator. In this paper, a detailed closed-form dynamic model is derived using the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm, which extended to include the most significant hydrodynamic effects. In the dynamic modeling and simulation, the actuator and sensor dynamics of the system are also incorporated. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated using numerical simulations along with comparative study between conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controls. The results are confirmed that the actual states of joint trajectories of the underwater manipulator asymptotically follow the desired trajectories defined by the reference model even though the system is subjected to external disturbances and parameter uncertainties.

abstract={This paper presents the detailed modelling and simulation of the dynamic coupling in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-manipulator system, used for deep-sea intervention tasks. The interaction effects due to damping, restoring and inertial effects of a single degree of freedom (DOF) manipulator mounted on an underactuated AUV are analysed. The actuator and sensor dynamics of the system are also considered. The linear and angular position errors of the vehicle and the manipulator due to the interaction effects between them are also investigated and the results are presented. A model reference adaptive control (MRAC) scheme is proposed to compensate the above mentioned errors. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated using numerical simulations along with comparative study between conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The robustness of the proposed control scheme is also illustrated with numerical study in the presence of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. © 2011 ICROS.},

abstract={For autonomous manipulation in water, an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) should be able to generate trajectori9es for the vehicle and manipulators and track the planned trajectories accurately. In this paper, for trajectory generation, we suggest a performance index for redundancy resolution. This index is designed to minimize the restoring moments of the UVMS during manipulation, and it is optimized without impeding the performance of a given task. As a result, the restoring moments of the UVMS are decreased, and control efforts are also reduced. For tracking control of the UVMS, a nonlinear H∞ optimal control with disturbance observer is proposed. This control is robust against parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, and actuator nonlinearities. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed coordinated motion control of the UVMS. The results show that control inputs for tracking are reduced, and the UVMS can successfully track generated trajectories. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study presents a novel tracking control scheme for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) where the proposed controller is not only used to track the prescribed sub-region but also allows the use of the self-motion to perform various sub-tasks (i.e. drag minimisation, obstacle avoidance and manipulability) because of the kinematically redundant system. In the proposed control scheme, the desired primary task of the UVMS is specified as two sub-regions that are assigned for the vehicle and end-effector. Despite the parametric uncertainty associated with the underwater dynamic model, the controller ensures the sub-task tracking without affecting the sub-region and attitude tracking control objective. The Lyapunov-type approach is utilised to design the controller and an extension to an adaptive-robust control scheme with multiple sub-regions and sub-task objectives is also performed to illustrate the flexibility of the approach. The presence of variable ocean currents creates hydrodynamic forces and moments that are not well known or predictable, even though they are bounded. Therefore the control task of tracking a prescribed sub-region trajectory is challenging because of these additive bounded disturbances.

abstract={This paper presents our recent advances in specification, planning and control of autonomous manipulation actions in underwater environments. The user first specifies the task to perform on a target object found on a seabed image mosaic previously obtained. Then a suitable vehicle position and arm configuration is planned in order to guarantee a successful manipulation. After the vehicle reaches the planned destination, the actual view of the object is matched to the one used for the specification, and the grasp points are tracked, enabling visual servoing of the manipulator end-effector. This allows the arm to compensate for the vehicle motion, thus increasing the reliability of the reaching action. Preliminary experiments done in a simulated environment demonstrate the viability of this approach. © 2011 IFAC.},

abstract={Autonomous underwater vehicles are increasingly replacing the prevalent remotely operated vehicle-manipulator systems. Most current generation AUVs are not fitted with manipulators and hence are mainly limited to underwater surveying and surveillance tasks because of the difficulty in the coordinated control of the resulting underwater vehicle-manipulator systems. While several researchers have proposed various techniques for control of AUVs, there is still much research to be done on the precise control of underwater manipulators. This paper presents an intelligent control method for underwater manipulators based on the neuro-fuzzy approach. The controller is composed of fuzzy PD control with feedback gain tuning by linguistic rules. A neural network compensator approximates the dynamics of the multiple degrees of freedom manipulator in decentralized form. The proposed controller has advantages of simplicity of implementation due to decentralized design, precision, and robustness to payload variations and hydrodynamic disturbances. It has lower energy consumption compared to the conventional PD control method. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated by experimental results for a three degrees of freedom underwater manipulator. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, the dynamics modelling strategy of a tethered underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) coupled with a and spatial manipulator have been studied. With regards to the cable dynamic modelling, it is considered to be a series of lumped point masses connected by linear, massless, visco-elastic springs. In addition, the model accounts for the tether bending and twisting effects. Regarding the manipulator dynamics, the Articulated-Body Algorithm is employed due to its computational efficiency. In order to control the ROV motion under disturbance forces and moments caused by the tether and the manipulator motion, a series of Model-based SISO sliding-mode controllers are implemented and the ABA is used to predict the dynamic coupling force expressions based on the feedback of ROV and the manipulator states. The control gains of the sliding-mode controllers are defined as a closed function of the articulated inertias of the ABA algorithm; leading to time varying gains as opposed to constant as in conventional methods. As a case study, a Saab-Seaeye FALCON™ ROV with a modified Hydrolek™ HLK 43000 manipulator is presented. Numerical simulations are performed to reveal the extent to which the tether dominates the Falcon-manipulator dynamics. It is shown that disturbance forces and moments created by tether motion must be actively compensated using while the ROV is held stationary during manipulator operation. It is also shown that the use of force sensors at the FALCON™'s tether termination can dramatically improve the performance of the series of SISO sliding mode controllers. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={A Jacobian-based algorithm that is useful for planning the motion of a floating rigid body operated using two input torques is addressed in this paper. The rigid body undergoes a four-rotation fully reversed (FR) sequence of rotations which consists of two initial rotations about the axes of a coordinate frame attached to the body and two subsequent rotations that undo the preceding rotations. Although a Jacobian-based algorithm has been useful in exploring the inverse kinematics of conventional robot manipulators, it is not apparent how a correct FR sequence for a desired orientation could be found because the Jacobian of FR sequences is singular as well as being a null matrix at the identity. To discover the FR sequences that can synthesize the desired orientation circumventing these difficulties, the Jacobian algorithm is reformulated and implemented from arbitrary orientations where the Jacobian is not singular. Due to the insufficient degrees-of-freedom of four-rotation FR sequences required to achieve all possible orientations, the rigid body cannot achieve certain orientations in the configuration space. To best approximate these infeasible orientations, the Jacobian-based algorithm is implemented in the sense of least squares. As some orientations can never be attained by a single four-rotation FR sequence, two different four-rotation FR sequences are exploited alternately to ensure the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Assuming the orientation is supposed to be manipulated using three input torques, the switching Jacobian algorithm proposed in this paper has significant practical importance in planning paths for aerospace and underwater vehicles which are maneuvered using only two input torques due to the failure of one of the torque-generation mechanisms. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Path generation in 3 dimensions is addressed in this paper. In control of autonomous underwater or aerial vehicles, as well as manipulators' end-effector, it is required that the planned path exhibits specific characteristics of continuity up to the second, or third, order time derivatives. It is known, in fact, that closed loop performance benefits from regular enough control commands. In this paper, the path is supposed to be given in terms of 3D curves, such as, e.g., segments or circle' arcs, that need to be connected and that may eventually intersect in a point; in the latter case, the maximum distance from the intersection's point (via-point) needs to be strictly respected. Then, an effective solution to the problem of generating a smooth transition curve between two generic curves satisfying a maximum distance constraint from the intersecting point has been proposed. To test the approach, several case studies show its performance.},

abstract={Path planning in unknown environments such as Mars or underwater are not only challenging but also daunting tasks. While significant advances are made for mobile platforms, manipulator motion planning in unknown environments still falls short of full fledged solutions due to the uncertainty and complexity of higher order configuration spaces. Most feasible solutions proposed so far are either modeling unknown environments in realtime or applying randomized model based planners with sensitive skin type sensors. Although solving unknown environment planning problems with randomized model based approaches seems very promising, no systematic study has been reported as to how to adopt model based planners into the sensor based problem domain effectively. In this paper, we study the adoption issues of model based planners to tackle sensor based planning problems, and hence provide conversion guidelines from one to other problem domain. In addition, we discuss the range effect of the sensitive skin type sensor, IPA, for on-line planning in unknown environments. Some experimental results in an unknown environment are presented in the paper as well. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel underwater movement compensation algorithm for stabilization of manipulator position utilizing not ROV movements for disturbance comensation, but overlaid manipulator movements. A model based estimator is used to predict vehicle movement and provide the manipulation system with the necessary time to compensate for the estimated motion. It describes the conceptual benefits of this approach compared with common station-keeping algorithms, and shows how previous methods can be combined with the new approach in order to further improve manipulator position accuracy. The method is validated in a number of experiments, which show its feasability and outstanding performance. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Path planning in unknown environments such as unexplored planets or underwater is not only a challenging but also daunting task, especially for a multi-degree manipulator. The most feasible solutions proposed so far are either modeling unknown environments in real time or applying randomized model-based planner (MBP) to tackle unknown environments. As for the latter case, however, no significant study has been carried out as to what are the issues for conversion of a randomized MBP to solve an unknown environment planning problem. In this paper, we investigate essential technical issues when tackling a manipulator planning problem in unknown environments using a senson-based planner (SBP). Second, we empirically study the sensing range effect of a sampling-based planner when used in an unknown environment as well. Noticeably evident in the study was that the larger sensing range exponentially diminishes the time of convergence, thus ensuring probabilistically faster planning of a manipulator in unknown environments.},

abstract={The autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) is a kind of UVMS which can have autonomous operation abilities for underwater application. It employs a combination of sensors to autonomously detect targets, conduct environmental measurement and finally implement operations with its manipulator. In this paper, a target locating method based on stereo vision is proposed for trajectory planning of autonomous UVMS. First, the raw images are captured by a binocular camera and preprocessed by the contrast limited adaptive histogram specification (CLAHS) algorithm to make contrast enhancement. Then SURF features are extracted and tracked, and the 3D point-coordinates are calculated by the triangulation method. Two methods, the homography transformation method and geometric centroids method, are proposed to estimate the target's position under the camera frame. Finally the location estimation result is analyzed under the camera's frame and the world frame, and the errors on three directions of the world frame are given. Experiments indicate that this method is effective and easy to use while supplying the aid to UVMS for locating the target.},

abstract={Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) is a multi-body system with float base. It is difficult to control the vehicle for its dynamic uncertainty and the multi-joint manipulator's disturbances. Due to it is not easy to get the manipulator's hydrodynamics and vehicle's propeller model, an adaptive controller based fuzzy CMAC is proposed. The neural network's inputs are motion status of vehicle and manipulator, and its outputs are the control voltage of the vehicle's propellers. The control errors are decreasing by the controller's self-study with the disturbances of the manipulator. The paper presents the controller's design and stability analysis. To improve the robustness of the controller, input compensation is added. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

abstract={This study investigates the performance of the fuzzy model reference adaptive control method applied on a 2-dof underwater planar manipulator (MIMO system). Takagi-Sugeno fuzzification is chosen for the fuzzy system and the proportional-integral update law is used in the adjustment mechanism to obtain a fast parameters adoption. The present study consists the proposed controller performance in response to the need to control the manipulator with the added terms in the dynamic equation, i.e., hydrodynamic effects brought about by ocean drift. In the presence of the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic effects of sea water, the performance of the controller is analyzed in terms of servo tracking at each of the manipulator joints. The simulation results demonstrate that the actual joint trajectories of the manipulator for both joints asymptotically follow the desired trajectories defined by the reference model even though the plant is subjected to external disturbances and input variations.},

abstract={When an underwater robot is to work under the water, the manipulator has to reach out. This can change the center of the gravity and cause the robot pitching. It's difficult to make a maneuver for a pitched robot. An automechanism was developed to balance the pose of the robot. A sliding mode variable structure controller was designed to control the balance device, in which a disturbance observer was used to observe the disturbances. This reduced the switching-gain of the control system greatly and weakened the chattering more of course. A practical result was achieved for the control of pitch change of the robot caused by the manipulators and detecting pan/tilt and indicated the practicability of the balance device including its control approach. As the device is a single-axis system, a double-axes system is needed for the balance of pitching and rolling. abstract is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top of the left-hand column as it is here, below the author information.

abstract={In underwater remote vehicle-manipulator system (URVM) applications, it is beneficial to have the underwater remote vehicle (URV) hold station using its thrusters while a human pilot operates the serial manipulator. This provides a stable platform for the manipulator and eases the pilot's job drastically when current and/or tether disturbances are present. The contribution of this work is twofold: Firstly, the reduction of dynamic coupling in the URVM systems is realized using two robust control techniques namely Sliding-mode control and H∞ control, and the performance of both controllers in the dynamic coupling reduction problem is reported. Secondly, a new control scheme is proposed that involves both controllers in the control loop. Numerical case studies are developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controllers. It is concluded that sliding-mode and H∞ controller combined approach provides superior dynamic coupling reduction performance.},

abstract={Manipulators mounted on unmanned submarines are inherently kinematically redundant. Such systems, which are normally controlled by operators from within a vessel on the sea, can follow a desired path both by moving its manipulator or the submarine itself. Due to this redundancy one might control the system such that it tracks the desired path and fulfil some secondary tasks at the same time. Due to different inertia of vehicle and manipulator it is convenient to perform fast manoeuvres by manipulator and leave the submarine uncontrolled until the manipulator reaches its physical limits or some other secondary tasks are violated. This paper presents a method based on fuzzy logic for redundancy resolution of such a manipulator system during a welding mission under the sea. The method accounts for velocity disturbances induced in submarine by underwater stream. It also makes it possible to prioritize secondary tasks and also the motion in different degrees of freedom of the system. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, coordinated motion control of Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) is addressed. In order for UVMS to carry out manipulation tasks alone, motion planning with consideration of redundancy and tracking control under disturbances are required. We propose redundancy resolution with optimization of restoring moments as motion planning and inverse optimal nonlinear H∞ control as robust tracking controller. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate performance of proposed coordinated motion control of UVMS. As a result, control input for tracking is reduced and UVMS can track generated trajectories under parameter uncertainties. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={In this article, the adaptive learning method of the radial basic function neural network is used on the variable structure sliding mode control of underwater robot to estimate and approach the upper bound of the uncertainty and disturbance induced by hydrodynamics. With this study method, the difficulties of establishment and resolving of precision dynamic model of underwater robot can be avoided. Based on the description and setting up of the control model, a tracking MATLAB simulation was performed and a series of tests on the yaw of underwater robot with all equipments of observation and manipulators were performed in a static water pool. The results of experiment showed that this control approach is available for the underwater robot. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={It is proposed to use anchor manipulators to provide a stable operating environment for underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) in this paper. The kinematics equation of ROVs-Manipulators system is modeled and the motion planning of ROVs-Manipulators system (ROVMS) is described, then, a task-priority redundancy inverse kinematic solution technique based on weighted-least norm (WLN) solution is developed which address twofold aimsone for avoiding joint limit and controlling the manipulator end-effectors position, and other for limiting configuration of the ROVs vehicle. Computational aspects of the solutions are also considered in view of real-time implementation of a kinematic control algorithm. The method is applied to ROVs mounded with a five-degree-of-freedom SIWR-II Underwater-manipulator. The results from computer simulations demonstrate its effectiveness. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a new motion control scheme is presented for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). The system is composed of a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and an n robot manipulator that is mounted on the AUV. We use Quasi-Lagrange formulation to gain the model of UVMS, which include considers major hydrodynamic effects. A sliding mode controller is designed to implement control of the trajectory tracking. The advantage of this controller is that it doesn't require a model of the whole UVMS, and ensures robust performance in the presence of disturbances and dynamic interactions. Finally, computer simulations are performed to verify the efficacy of the motion control scheme and the conclusion are presented in the end of this paper.},

abstract={Since Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator Systems (UVMS) are necessary for ocean exploration, many studies have been done about UVMS. However, as there are only a few experimental studies, we have proposed Resolved Acceleration Control (RAC) methods for UVMS. The effectiveness of the proposed methods have been verified by experiments using an underwater robot with 2 dimensional and vertical planar 2-link manipulator. Since the proposed methods have position and velocity feedbacks, the influence of an inaccurate hydrodynamic model can be reduced. To obtain higher control performance, we propose a continuous time RAC method with disturbance compensation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={The problem of redundancy resolution for underwater remote vehicle-manipulator systems (URVM) is addressed in the current work. In URVM applications, it is beneficial to have the underwater remote vehicle (URV) hold station using its thrusters while a human pilot operates the serial manipulator. This provides a stable platform for the manipulator and eases the pilot's job drastically when current and/or tether disturbances are present. However, when following this objective, the redundancy of the URVM as a whole is wasted; the four actively controlled motions of the URV are not used to improve the efficacy of the manipulator task, In fact, this standard operating procedure frequently puts the manipulator into near singular configurations. This is not desirable from the manipulator controller standpoint since near singular configurations result in undesirably high joint velocities and oscillations. In this work, a new heuristic approach based on the task-priority redundancy resolution scheme is applied to the URVM. The proposed approach provides a means to avoid singular configurations of the manipulator, and provides dexterous manipulation by using the URV's mobility in an optimal, coordinated manner. This scheme is particularly useful for remote systems where an a priori trajectory generator is not applicable. Numerical case studies are developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.},

The design basically consists of an adaptive neural controller, which implements a feedback linearization control for an underwater manipulator with unknown parameters, and a sliding-mode control that compensates for the neural approximation errors. It is proved that the close-loop system is stable and the trajectory-tracking control objective is achieved.

abstract={A model-based monocular vision system for station keeping of an underwater vehicle is presented. Through such system accurate and reliable 3D pose information (roll, pitch, yaw and XYZ translations) of the vehicle relative to the model-known observed target is estimated in real time. The cooperative and observed target is placed in the working space when station keeping is demanded. The performance of the system is demonstrated in a water tank by using the underwater vehicle, which 4 degrees-of-freedom are controllable. With the pose information, the vehicle can automatically move to a desired station and maintain a fixed position and orientation with the presence of disturbance. The system is suitable for the underwater vehicles equipped with manipulators or in the structural environment, and will have a good prospect in the future applications. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={A fundamental network design problem is that of designing "efficient" routes for moving products, resources and information through a network. Usually the route must satisfy a variety of constraints. The efficiency of a network can be measured in terms of cost, reliability, throughput or length of path used. The constraints of a network can consist of delivery/pickup time deadlines, network availability, the need to visit specific nodes of the network, or resource restrictions such as vehicle capacity, fleet size or transmission rates to name a few. We consider a class of path design problems which arise when an object needs to traverse between two points through a specified region, the Transit Path Problem being one such problem. The Transit Path Problem is to determine an optimal path, in terms of minimizing risk or cost or maximizing reliability, for an object, such as a robot or vehicle, that needs to traverse a specified region between two points. This problem arises in many areas of real life. For example, the routing of military vehicles through a detection field or the routing of a new highway in a given terrain. Other applications include motion planning for robot manipulators through a field of obstacles and the generation of optimal trajectories for air, space, naval and land vehicles. We specifically look at the problem of determining an optimal transit path for a submarine moving through a field of sonar sensors, subject to a total time constraint. The strategy presented involves a two stage approach. The first stage is a discretization of the problem and the development of a network heuristic method, based upon a parameterisation using a convex combination, to solve the resulting network. The second stage involves the use of an optimal control model, the application of the CPET technique, and a solution procedure that utilizes the solution obtained in the first stage as a starting point. In the proposed model each of the sensors can detect the presence of the submarine with a probability which is a given function depending on the distance between the two and on the speed of the submarine. This function is not a simple analytical expression, but depends upon a range of factors, including the characteristics of the ocean floor and ocean surface, depths of the sensor and the submarine, and the temperature and salinity of the water. In this paper, we use probability of detection functions reported in (Hallam 1997). These were constructed under the assumptions that the geographic location and environmental conditions are known and that the submarine remains at a constant depth. Furthermore, each of the given functions is constructed for a particular constant vessel speed. While there are still further factors influencing the probability of detection (such as machinery states, frequency of the sensor, alertness of sensor operators or quality of the automatic detection, the relative aspect of the submarine and the sensor, the effect of sudden changes in travel direction or speed), the functions from (Hallam 1997) contain sufficient detail to test the feasibility of the proposed method. The overall probability of detection at any point in time can then be calculated as an appropriate combination of these individual probabilities of detection. Here, we make the assumption that the probability of detection for any one sensor is independent of the probabilities of detection for the other sensors. The objective then is to find a transit path between two fixed positions in the sensor field which will minimize the overall probability of detection while still satisfying a maximum travel time constraint. The difficulty is due to the fact that the transit time must satisfy an upper bound constraint. Computational results support the use of our methodology. They show the heuristic we use to be both efficient and satisfactory. The heuristic generates a good quality initial solution for the discretized network problem. This starting path is then refined by means of an optimal control approach. In this phase of our procedure we make use of the optimal control software package MISER3. Improvements can be made in the range of 9 to 34% by employing the optimal control approach.},

abstract={Collision detection and obstacle avoidance are two features that play an important role in fully or partly autonomous operations of robotic manipulators in cluttered environments. A compact and fast collision-avoidance scheme would be particularly useful for robotic applications in space, underwater, and hazardous environments. Collision avoidance for robot manipulators can be divided into two categories: end-effector level and link level. Much of the work reported to date has dealt with obstacle avoidance as an off-line path planning problem, i.e., find a collision-free path for the end-effector [7], [28], or by mapping the obstacle into joint space, find a collision-free path in joint space [36], [11]. These methods are not applicable to environments with moving objects. Moreover, for non-redundant manipulators, tracking an end-effector trajectory while avoiding collisions with obstacles at the link level, or self-collision avoidance, is often not achievable. Kinematic redundancy has been recognized as a major characteristic for operation of a robot in a cluttered environment [33]. For redundant manipulators, a real-time collision avoidance approach has been developed recently by Seraji and Bon [70] that formulates the problem as a force-control problem so that the task of collision avoidance is solved primarily by augmenting the manipulator control strategy. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={Oceans, the familiar environment for us, are an attractive environment because of abundant mineral resources, energy, space, and so on, and underwater research and development are carried out rapidly during recent decades. However, the extreme conditions such as high water pressure, invisibility and non-oxygen become great barriers for human to access directly. Underwater robots are expected and developed as efficient tools for the operation instead of human beings. In order to realize underwater robots, the autonomy and intelligence of robots are one of the most important research topics and AUVs are the new tools for underwater operations. The demand of getting work using AUVs will increase and the missions become more and more complicated. Therefore, manipulators which are mounted on AUVs are expected to play an Important role for complex tasks. This paper discusses the dynamics and control of an underwater robot equipped with a manipulator. The motion of multi-body systems in underwater environment has a lot of difficulties because that all bodies are not kept on fixed objects, and the movement of a body effects other bodies and excites each other, etc. The fluid dynamics also makes the problem more complicated matter. The nonlinear forces, such as drag forces and hydraulic forces, act on both the manipulators and the robot vehicle. Recent years, many studies on Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator Systems (UVMS) have been examined. We have also studied dynamics and control of a manipulator mounted on a robot in horizontal and vertical plane and proposed a method using Resolved Acceleration Control (RAC). In this paper, kinematics and dynamics of a 2-link underwater manipulator mounted on an AUV "Twin-Burger" which was developed as a testbed for intelligent software development, and a RAC method for underwater manipulator is described. Next, the routing algorithm using the dynamic manipulability of the robot is proposed considering the coordinate action between manipulator and AUV. In order to evaluate effectiveness of the RAC method and the routing algorithm numerical simulations are performed. The simulation results show the good control performance. Based on the simulation, we designed a Manipulator using a CAD system. Magnet coupling method is introduced to transfer torque into the joints in order to realize waterproof mechanism. Finally, we examined the performance of proposed path planning algorithm through experiment.},

abstract={Most commercial underwater manipulators to date belong to master-slave type. The disadvantage of the system is that it requires the operator be well trained and fully skilled. Hence a robot manipulator system with high intelligence should be developed to fulfill the need of less-skilled or even non-skilled operators. In response to the above needs, we have designed and implemented an intelligent underwater robotic manipulator system to enhance the capability of the robotic manipulator. This developing system consists of a manipulator, a distance measurement system, water-proof camera, computer, interface technology and task planning technology etc. The system is constructed as a windows-guided, supervisory underwater robotic manipulator system. The underwater manipulator was designed and fabricated to be an articulate type robot with five rotary joints, including waist, shoulder, elbow, wrist-pitch, and wrist-roll motion. The system consists four subsystems to facilitate the intelligence behavior of the robotic system. The modules include a task planning module, an image process and identification module a distance measurement module, and a motion planning and control module.A prototype of teleoperated underwater robotic manipulator systems has been setup. The finished prototype underwater manipulator system have been used as a test station for underwater operation, to crip and more a object. The set up system is hanged under a manipulator is installed on the 6 degree of freedom rotation platforms to simulate ROV motion under sea. The remotely teleoperated robot manipulator system hanged under the 6 degree of freedom rotation platform can finish a underwater construction. To demonstrate the ability of the underwater robotic manipulator system, we designed an experiment for the underwater manipulator under the 6 degree of freedom rotation platforms to simulating ROV under sea to accomplish an object crip under water with robotic system. The task planning module incorporated with the commands from the control panel, forms the highest control level of the system. In the manipulator system, the image module functions as a pre-process. It deals with tasks such as extracting target objects from CCD-images, and more importantly, providing information needed by the planning module. In distance measurement module, we have test ultrasonic and laser distance measurement system to offer main system accuracy distance information. In the motion planning and control module, the coordinates of the target position are obtained from the task planning module, then the inverse kinematics of the manipulator is performed to derive the joint angle for each joint. © 2004 IEEE.},

abstract={This work considers the computational costs associated with the implementation of a failure-tolerant path planning algorithm proposed in [1]. The algorithm makes the following assumptions: a manipulator is redundant relative to its task, only a single joint failure occurs at any given time, the manipulator is capable of detecting a joint failure and immediately locks the failed joint, and the environment is static and known. The algorithm is evaluated on a three degree-of-freedom planar manipulator for a total of eleven thousand different scenarios, randomly varying the robot's start and goal positions and the number and locations of obstacles in the environment. Statistical data are presented related to the computation time required by the different steps of the algorithm as a function of the complexity of the environment.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and the analysis of a "fish-like underwater robot". In order to develop swimming robot like a real fish, extensive hydrodynamic analysis were made followed by the study of biology of the fishes especially its maneuverability and propel styles. Swimming mode is achieved by mimicking fish-swimming of carangiform. This is the swimming mode of the fast motion using its tail and peduncle for propulsion. In order to generate configurations of vortices that gives efficient propulsion yawing and surging with a caudal fin has applied and in order to submerge and maintain the body balance pitching and heaving motion with a pair of pectoral fin is used. We have derived the equation of motion of PoTuna by two methods. In first method, we use the equation of motion of underwater vehicle with the potential flow theory for the power of propulsion. In second method, we apply the method of the equation of motion of UVM(Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator). Then, we compare these results.},

abstract={A new unified motion planning algorithm for autonomous Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator Systems (UVMS) has been presented in this paper. Commonly, a UVMS consists of two sub-systems, a vehicle and a manipulator, having vastly different dynamic responses. The proposed algorithm considers the variability in dynamic bandwidth of the complex UVMS system and generates not only kinematically admissible but also dynamically feasible reference trajectories. Additionally, this motion planning algorithm exploits the inherent kinematic redundancy of the whole system and provides reference trajectories that accommodates other important criteria such as thruster/actuator faults and saturations, and also minimizes hydrodynamic drag. Effectiveness of the proposed unified motion planning algorithm has been verified by extensive computer simulation. The results are quite promising.},

abstract={In this paper, an approach for the autonomous motion planning for an underwater manipulator is proposed. An aim of this approach is to decide tip positions of the manipulator and manipulator's postures in the water. Therefore this approach is composed of the tip position planning and the posture planning. And in order to execute each planning, a workspace of a manipulator is divided into cubes. In the tip position planning, a cube is selected as an objective tip position from among twenty-six cubes in the workspace. And in the posture planning, manipulator's postures are evaluated using the positional relation between the manipulator and obstacle domains defined by some cubes, so that a secure manipulator's posture to avoid obstacle is decided. And owing to executing each planning repetitively, the whole manipulator's motion is planned. In this paper, the validity of the proposed approach is shown in experimental results.},

abstract={This paper explores the use of virtual reality technology to help visualize the remote environment and control the remote underwater robot indirectly. Also an online parameter prediction system is developed to cope with the time delay. The paper consists of two parts: (I) the development of improved virtual model based teleoperating system, and (II) an investigation into the feasibility of the predictor performance. The experimental system is an Internet-based teleoperating system for an underwater 7-axis manipulator. The task of this project is a time-limited task. That is to retrieve and catch a moving target in the water through the tele-operating system.},

abstract={Underwater vehicle-manipulator (UVM) systems have been suggested for inspection, maintenance, repair and construction of underwater structures. The addition of manipulators to the vehicle makes control of the system more difficult due to the interaction forces between vehicle and manipulator. So, the efficient compensation of those interactions should be considered for accurate control of both subsystems. For precision control of the end-effectors, at the first step, it is essential to analyze the kinematics and dynamics of the whole UVM systems. And then, the robust controller has to be introduced over the interaction disturbances. In this paper, firstly, the kinematic and dynamic analysis about the whole UVM system is executed. The whole dynamics is divided by meaningful terms. And, a robust coordinated motion control algorithm for autonomous UVM systems is considered. For the manipulation, the vehicle movement may be not desirable, because the small movement of vehicle affect significant changes of the end-effectors. And, a vehicle is relatively smaller bandwidth system than manipulators. For this reason, in this paper, active damping control with two-time scale approach for the manipulator is used with passive vehicle. Using this algorithm, the manipulator controller can deal with the vehicle state additionally.},

abstract={This paper introduces a homing and docking control of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using model predictive control. There are many system uncertainties in modeling of AUV and disturbances in a deep sea. Therefore, model of AUV will be changed according to velocity of AUV, a sea current, circumstances of a sea, and etc. And many disturbances also are added to AUV systems in deep sea. Receding horizon tracking control (RHTC) is a kind of model predictive control and controller is recalculated by solving finite horizon optimal control problems at every time. Recalculated controller at every time is suitable for a system with changing systems parameters, sudden environment changes, or arbitrarily maneuvering target. Therefore, RHTC is one of the appropriate control methods to control AUV's motions. In this paper, regulating and tracking control of AUV are studied using RHTC to control homing and docking of AUV when launcher moves vertically and horizontally. Receding horizon tracking controller can manage systems with moving launcher because homing and docking paths of AUV and the position of launcher are updated and predicted at every time. Results are presented by simulations.},

abstract={A new method to analyze dynamics of underwater robot manipulators is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, hydrodynamic terms such as added mass, drag and buoyancy in dynamics of underwater robots are obtained by iterative learning control and time-scale transformation. The advantage of the proposed method is not to use parameter estimation of the dynamics. In this paper, we explain that the proposed method can be applied to hardware design, motion control and motion planning of underwater robots. Moreover, the experimental results using a 1-DOF and a 3-DOF manipulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={We introduce the notion of kinematic controllability for second-order underactuated mechanical systems. For systems satisfying this property, the problem of planning fast collision-free trajectories between zero velocity states can be decoupled into the computationally simpler problems of path planning for a kinematic system followed by time-optimal time scaling. While this approach is well known for fully actuated systems, until now there has been no way to apply it to underactuated dynamic systems. The results in this paper form the basis for efficient collision-free trajectory planning for a class of underactuated mechanical systems including manipulators and vehicles in space and underwater environments.},

abstract={This paper describes a new framework for segmentation of sonar images, tracking of underwater objects and motion estimation. This framework is applied to the design of an obstacle avoidance and path planning system for underwater vehicles based on a multi-beam forward looking sonar sensor. The real-time data flow (acoustic images) at the input of the system is first segmented and relevant features are extracted. We also take advantage of the real-time data stream to track the obstacles in following frames to obtain their dynamic characteristics. This allows us to optimize the preprocessing phases in segmenting only the relevant part of the images. Once the static (size and shape) as well as dynamic characteristics (velocity, acceleration, ...) of the obstacles have been computed, we create a representation of the vehicle's workspace based on these features. This representation uses constructive solid geometry (CSG) to create a convex set of obstacles defining the workspace. The tracking takes also into account obstacles which are no longer in the field of view of the sonar in the path planning phase. A well-proven nonlinear search (sequential quadratic programming) is then employed, where obstacles are expressed as constraints in the search space. This approach is less affected by local minima than classical methods using potential fields. The proposed system is not only capable of obstacle avoidance but also of path planning in complex environments which include fast moving obstacles. Results obtained on real sonar data are shown and discussed. Possible applications to sonar servoing and real-time motion estimation are also discussed.},

abstract={A new motion coordination algorithm for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) is proposed. This algorithm generates the desired trajectories for both the vehicle and the manipulator in such a way that the total hydrodynamic drag on the system is minimized. Resolution of kinematic redundancy of the system is performed at the acceleration level so that this algorithm can be incorporated into the system dynamics. The dynamics of the UVMS are modeled using a quasi-Lagrange approach. A state-space formulation of the system along with a model-based controller design for trajectory-following tasks that includes thruster dynamics is also presented. The computer simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed method in reducing the drag on the system.},

abstract={This paper describes a navigation and guidance system (NGS) with real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance capabilities that has been developed for the autonomous underwater vehicle RAIS. The vehicle is designed to accomplish two missions: pre-deployment survey of sea bottom, and visual inspection of pipelines. In the first mission, the NGS must be able to track a predefined path while avoiding the unplanned occurrence of obstacles. In the second mission, the NGS must track a pipeline by locally reconstructing its location from visual information; also in this case, the unplanned occurrence of obstacles must be handled. Furthermore, the NGS must properly take into account the presence of ocean current and some drastic constraints due to sensor and actuator characteristics. Numerical and hardware-in-the-loop simulations have been developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed NGS.},

abstract={We introduce the notion of kinematic controllability for second-order underactuated mechanical systems. For systems satisfying this property, the problem of planning fast collision-free trajectories between zero velocity states can be decoupled into the computationally simpler problems of path planning for a kinematic system followed by time-optimal time scaling. While this approach is well known for fully actuated systems, until now there has been no way to apply it to underactuated dynamic systems. The results in this paper form the basis for efficient collision-free trajectory planning for a broad class of underactuated mechanical systems including manipulators and vehicles in space and underwater environments.},

abstract={In this paper, we focus on the technology development and implementation of an intelligent underwater robotic manipulator system. The objective is to establish an underwater manipulator system that has the capability of remotely teleoperated, window-guided supervisory control, high-level task planning, and image sensing. The system includes four main modules according to their functionality. They are: task planning module, image process and identification module, distance measurement module, and motion control module. The key components developed include a five-jointed underwater manipulator, an ultrasonic distance measuring system, an image process and identification software, and a Petri-Net based task-planning software. The manipulator was designed and fabricated to be an articulate type robot with five rotary joints. Considering the poor visibility in the underwater environment, we used self-fabricated ultrasonic device to detect the object and measure the distance between the manipulator's base and the object. For the task-planning process, we applied the colored Petri-Net technology to define the model of the underwater tasks. For the image identification process, we established an image process module that is responsible for providing clear underwater image, performing pattern recognition tasks, and generating imagery information demanded by the task-planning module. For the motion control and trajectory planning process, polynomial interpolation was used for the trajectory planning, and real-time inverse kinematics was performed to obtain the actuators' input angles. By integrating the above technologies, the finished prototype of the manipulator system shows its ability to achieve our research goals.},

abstract={Hydrodynamics of the manipulator mounted on the vehicle are poorly known and time-varying. Furthermore, its motion is disturbed by the vehicle motion and current. This paper presents a non-regressor based adaptive control scheme with a disturbance observer for tracking the trajectory of underwater mobile platform-mounted manipulators. The presented control system does not require any information about the system. The disturbance observer regards the difference between the actual output and the output of the nominal model as an equivalent disturbance applied to the nominal model. The adaptive control law then estimates control gains defined by the combinations of the bounded constants of parameter matrices of the nominal model with disturbance error. The performance of the proposed control scheme was evaluated by a computer simulation with a two-link planar manipulator mounted on a one degree-of-freedom mobile platform. The effect of hydrodynamic forces acting on the manipulator was also considered.},

abstract={This paper presents a control scheme for obtaining high maneuverability of underwater robot manipulators mounted on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The motions of an underwater manipulator can affect the attitude and position of the ROV which should remain stationary in seabed operation. To compensate for the dynamic effect of the underwater manipulator on the ROV, force-torque (F/T) information between the manipulator and the vehicle is used to regulate the states of the ROV. When an F/T sensor is practically unavailable, a disturbance observer can fill the role of the F/T sensor This paper proposes a disturbance observer for estimating the interaction forces between the ROV and the manipulator A two-link manipulator mounted on an ROV is considered and numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the improvement on the maneuverability of the proposed controller.},

abstract={Underwater exploration requires mobility and manipulation. Underwater robotic vehicles (URV) have been employed for mobility, and robot manipulators attached to the underwater vehicle (i.e. rover) perform the manipulation. Usually, the manipulation mode takes place when the rover is stationary. The URV is then modeled as a passive joint and joints of the manipulator are modeled as active joints. URV motions are determined by inherent dynamic couplings between active and passive joints. Furthermore, the control problem becomes complex since there are many hydrodynamic terms as well as intrinsic model uncertainties to be considered. To cope with these difficulties, we propose a disturbance observer-based robust control algorithm for underwater manipulators with passive joints. The proposed control algorithm is able to treat an underactuated system as a pseudo-active system in which passive joints are eliminated. Also, to realize a robust control method, a non-linear feedback disturbance observer is applied to each active joint. A four-jointed underwater robotic system with one passive joint is considered as an illustrative example. Through simulation, it is shown that the proposed control algorithm has good position tracking performance even in the presence of several external disturbances and model uncertainties.},

abstract={An approach to dynamics-based trajectory planning for systems composed of subsystems with different dynamic responses is presented in this paper. This approach requires that the task-space trajectory be represented in terms of Fourier series. Then the various frequency components from this series are used to generate the reference joint-space trajectories based on the natural frequencies of the respective subsystems. This approach is further extended for trajectory planning for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS), where the underwater vehicle has much slower response than the on-board manipulator. The advantage of this proposed dynamics-based planning methodology is its ability to generate both kinematically admissible and dynamically feasible trajectories. Results from computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={Underwater exploration requires mobility and manipulation. Underwater robotic vehicles (URV) have been employed for mobility, and robot manipulators attached to the underwater vehicle (i.e., rover) play the role of manipulation. Usually, manipulation mode happens when the rover is stationary. URV is then modeled as a passive joint and the joints of the manipulator are modeled as active joints. URV motions are determined by inherent dynamic couplings between active and passive joints. Furthermore, the control problem becomes complex since there should be considered many hydrodynamic terms as well as intrinsic model uncertainties. To cope with these difficulties, we propose a disturbance observer-based robust control algorithm for underwater manipulators with passive joints. The proposed control algorithm is able to treat an underactuated system as a pseudo active system in which passive joints are eliminated. Also, to realize a robust control method, a nonlinear feedback disturbance observer is applied to each active joint. A four-jointed underwater robotic system with one passive joint is considered as an illustrative example. Through simulation, it is shown that the proposed control algorithm has good position tracking performances even in the presence of several external disturbances and model uncertainties.},

abstract={A robust teleoperation controller design method for an underwater manipulator is proposed considering the master and the underwater slave separately. To achieve transparency and stability for a teleoperation of an underwater manipulator in unknown environments with time-varying uncertainties such as added mass, buoyancy, hydraulic drag and friction effect, an adaptive sliding mode control scheme is proposed for robust position tracking control of slave manipulator. To guarantee a force transparency in the master side, disturbance observer is used as a local controller for compensating a friction and coupled nonlinear dynamic effects of the master manipulator. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the transparency and robustness of the proposed controller.},

abstract={The control of underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) is a challenging task because the dynamics of such a system is highly nonlinear, coupled, time-varying, and subject to hydrodynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. This paper presents a non-regressor based adaptive control for UVMS where centralized and coordinated trajectory planning is followed by decentralized control - one for the slower subsystem (vehicle) and other for the faster subsystem (manipulator). To avoid joint limits, kinematic redundancy of the system is resolved using weighted pseudoinverse of the Jacobian matrix. The results from computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed method.},

The vehicle would automatically approach an underwater object, find weld seams, detect cracks and finally weld them. The first module is the ranging system. The experiments have shown that much better accuracy has been achieved when approximating polynomial functions are used instead of standard triangulation techniques. The second module detects and localises weld seams by extracting shape primitives corresponding to the expected configuration of seams from the laser-produced contours. Although the experiments are currently conducted in air, the proposed solution should be equally suitable for an underwater environment as well.},

abstract={This paper presents research on the hydrodynamic modeling of a manipulator for an autonomous underwater science vehicle. The focus is on improving the modeling accuracy of the in-line hydrodynamic coupling between a two-link manipulator and a small, free-floating vehicle in order to achieve better control for coordinated motion of the combined system. Loads predicted using existing models for underwater arms were determined to be off by as much as 25% when applied to a real, two-link arm in a test tank. In this new approach, an experimentally-determined model has been developed that takes into account 3-D flow effects that have previously not been included. The end result is a model that provides accurate predictions for the joint torques of a two-link arm in a form simple enough to be implemented in algorithms for precision planning and control.

abstract={With the use of multi-robot-systems new chances and perspectives are revealed for industrial, space- and underwater-applications. At the IRF, a versatile multi-robot-control, which fully exploits the inherent flexibility of a multi-robot-system, has been developed. In order to guarantee optimized system-throughput and increased autonomy, the system builds on a new resource-based action planning approach to coordinate the different robot manipulators and other automation components in the workcell. An important issue of the realized action planning component to be applicable to real world problems is that it is realized as an integral part of the hierarchical multi-robot control structure IRCS (Intelligent Robot Control System). The IRCS is the multi-robot control that was chosen by the German Space Agency (DLR) for major space automation projects. In this structure the resource-based action planning component is tightly integrated with components for coordinated task execution and collision avoidance to guarantee save operation of all agents in the multi-robot system. As the action planning component "understands" task descriptions on a high level of abstraction it is also the perfect counterpart for a Projective Virtual Reality (VR) system. The paper will describe the mechanism of resource based action planning, the practical experiences gained from the implementation for the IRCS as well as its services to support VR-based man machine interfaces.},

abstract={Amadeus (advanced manipulator for deep underwater sampling) is an international subsea manipulator project, funded by the European Union Marine Science and Technology Research Programme. The objective is to improve the sampling and manipulation capabilities of underwater systems, through the development of advanced grippers and manipulation control techniques. The three fingered hydraulic end-effectors utilize an innovative continuum finger construction, where motion is generated through the elastic deformation of bellows actuators and the fingers contain no moving parts. Independent finger control enables asymmetric grasps to be achieved on irregularly shaped objects and allows object manipulations to be performed solely through finger actuation. In addition the compliant continuum finger structure passively reacts to disturbances within the environment increasing grasp stability and reducing the risk of contact damage. The first Amadeus prototype was completed in 1996 and has been successfully used in the laboratory. Subsequently the objective of the second phase of the project is to build on this experience and produce a more robust system offering enhanced functionality and which is suitable for trials in the marine environment. This paper discusses end-effector requirements for robot manipulation in poorly structured environments and presents the rationale behind the Amadeus end-effectors. In particular the objectives and design of the first prototype are presented along with some of the modifications being incorporated into the second generation device.},

abstract={The formulation of the dynamic coupling between a manipulator and an underwater vehicle is presented. Results from a simulation of a particular manipulator-vehicle configuration illustrate the nature and extent of the dynamic coupling. The modeling processes for the underwater vehicle and the manipulator are described with an evaluation of the simple hydrodynamic effects that can be incorporated in the dynamic equations of the manipulator. The equations are formulated for the combination of a 6-degrees-of-freedom vehicle and a 3-degrees-of-freedom manipulator. The effect of the manipulator motion, assuming perfect manipulator joint angle tracking, on the vehicle's position/orientation and consequently the manipulator end-effector position is investigated assuming no vehicle control. Slotine's sliding mode approach has been used to reduce the effect of the manipulator disturbances. This technique allows the expressions developed for the manipulator disturbances to be incorporated in the control law. Control of the vehicle's yaw angle, in this particular manipulator-vehicle configuration, has been determined to be the single most important factor in reducing the end-effector error variation. This is shown to be beneficial in the regulation of the vehicle's yaw angle and offers improved performance compared to a sliding mode controller that does not incorporate the manipulator disturbances. This technique also demonstrates superior performance and insensitivity to parameter variations compared to a fixed-gain controller.},

abstract={In this paper, a trajectory planning method for an underwater manipulator is proposed. whose criterion of path generation is the energy consumption during operation. The trajectory planning for an underwater manipulator is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem. The minimumenergy trajectory is obtained as the solution of the two-point boundary-value problem. From the results of a series of numerical calculations, moving the manipulator (e.g. folding its arm) is effective to reduce energy consumption during motion. It is also clear that the optimal travel timeof the motion exists when an unbalance of static forces, buoyancy and gravity forces, occurred by a payload and so on. Then to calculate the trajectory without the complexity of formulation and computation, a simple trajectory planning method is also proposed, which uses a Genetic Algorithm(GA). In this method, a polynomial approximates time histories of the trajectory in joint space; the GA determines the parameter of the polynomial to minimize the energy consumption. This method does not need a special formulation and can calculate the trajectory with less computation thanthe previous method. Enhancing the problem to the search for the optimal travel time is easy.

abstract={AMADEUS is a dextrous subsea robot hand incorporating force and slip contact sensing, using fluid filled tentacles for fingers. Hydraulic pressure variations in each of three flexible tubes (bellows) in each finger create a bending moment, and consequent motion or increase in contact force during grasping. Such fingers have inherent passive compliance, no moving parts, and are naturally depth pressure-compensated, making them ideal for reliable use in the deep ocean. In addition to the mechanical design, development of the hand has also considered closed loop finger position and force control, co-ordinated finger motion for grasping, force and slip sensor development/signal processing, and reactive world modelling/planning for supervisory `blind grasping'. Initially, the application focus is for marine science tasks, but broader roles in offshore oil and gas, salvage, and military use are foreseen. Phase I of the project is complete, with the construction of a first prototype. Phase II is now underway, to deploy the hand from an underwater robot arm, and carry out wet trials with users. This paper summarizes the developments in phase I. Further details for each area of investigation are referenced.},

abstract={It is important to find a collision-free path for an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and manipulator, from an initial to a goal configuration, when considering automated vehicle activity in and around subsea structures. The problem is particularly acute when the combined motion of a vehicle and .manipulator is considered, due to large numbers of degrees of freedom (DOF) which produce a large search space, the need for an efficient search algorithm, the need for defining cost functions without local minima, and an efficient representation of object geometries to avoid collisions. Over the past 20 years, a great deal of interest and progress has developed in robot path planning. This paper concentrates on efficient searching and object representation, while removing local minima. A novel approach to subsea vehicle/manipulator path planning using a nonlinear programming approach is presented. The central idea is to represent the free space of the workspace as a set of inequality constraints of a nonlinear programming problem, using the vehicle configuration variables. The goal configuration is designed as the unique global minimum point of the objective function. The initial configuration is treated as the start point for the nonlinear search. Then the numerical algorithm developed for solving the nonlinear programming problem is applied to solve the robot motion planning problem. Every immediate point generated using the nonlinear optimisation search method guarantees that it is in the free space and, therefore, is collision free. Mathematical foundations for constructive solid geometry, Boolean operations and approximation techniques are developed and are used to represent the free space of the robot workspace as a set of inequalities. The advantages of this approach are that mature techniques developed in the past thirty years, in nonlinear programming theory for the direction of search which guarantees convergence, efficiency and numerical robustness, can be applied directly to the robot path-planning problem. Simulation results show its effectiveness, efficiency and its potential as an online motion planner. © IEE, 1997.},

abstract={Implementing tele-assistance or supervisory control for autonomous subsea robots requires atomic actions that can be called from high level task planners or mission managers. This paper reports on the design and implementation of a particular atomic action for the case of a subsea robot carrying out tasks in contact with the surrounding environment. Subsea vehicles equipped with manipulators can have upward of 11 degrees of freedom (DOF), with degenerate and redundant inverse kinematics. Distributed local motion planning is presented as a means to specify the motion of each robot DOF given a goal point or trajectory. Results are presented to show the effectiveness of the distributed versus non-distributed approach, a means to deal with local minima difficulties, and the performance for trajectory following with and without saturated joint angles on a robot arm. Consideration is also given to the modelling of hydraulic underwater robots and to the resulting design of hybrid position/force control strategies. A model for a hydraulically actuated robot is developed, taking into account the electrohydraulic servovalve, the bulk modulus of oil, piston area, friction, hose compliance and other arm parameters. Open and closed-loop control results are reported for simulated and real systems. Finally, the use of distributed motion planning and sequential position/force control of a Slingsby TA-9 hydraulic underwater manipulator is described, to implement an atomic action for tele-assistance. The specific task of automatically positioning and inserting a Tronic subsea mateable connector is illustrated, with results showing the contact conditions during insertion. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Manipulator movement produces force/moment disturbances which act on the underwater vehicle and alter its position, and consequently the manipulator end-effector position. The effect of the manipulator motion, assuming perfect manipulator joint angle tracking, on the vehicle's position and consequently the manipulator end-effector position is investigated assuming no vehicle control. Control of the vehicle's yaw angle, in this particular manipulator-vehicle configuration, has been determined to be the single most important factor in reducing the end-effector error variation. Due to the nonlinear dynamics of the vehicle, Slotine's sliding mode approach has been used. This technique allows the expressions developed for the manipulator disturbances to be incorporated in the control law. This is shown to be beneficial in the regulation of the vehicle's yaw angle, and offers improved performance compared with a sliding mode controller that does not incorporate the manipulator disturbances. This technique also demonstrates superior performance and insensitivity to parameter variations compared with a fixed-gain controller. © 1996, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Ocean development has been advanced for a long time in order to obtain ocean resources and energy, but its working environment is very severe for human beings, so underwater working robots which can be used instead of human beings have came into demand. This paper deals with attitude control of the main body of an unconstrained underwater robot using a movable counterweight controlled by the optimal servo system and trajectory control of a manipulator using disturbance compensation control (DCC). From the result obtained by computer simulations, it was made clear that the attitude of the main body can be controlled without steady-state error by means of controlling the position of the counterweight using the optimal servo system. In addition trajectory control of the manipulator can be carried out by using DCC which regards the reaction force due to the movement of the counterweight as a disturbance. © 1995, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

abstract={Motion planning with a high number of degrees of freedom (DOF) is computationally demanding. Coupled AUV-manipulators are an example where there can be as many as 14 DOF in a typical dual-arm configuration attached to an underwater vehicle exhibiting 6 DOF motion. In an underwater environment, autonomous vehicles are required to plan motion on-line, a non-trivial task for coupled AUV-manipulators. This paper examines the computational requirements of high DOF systems and presents a technique which allows fast execution of motion plans. This technique is implemented using distributed search in a 'local' motion planning context. Distributed search is achieved through the execution of a number of subsearches in parallel, where each subsearch contains a unique subset of the DOFs in the system. It will be shown how the use of this technique increases the effectiveness of the local motion planning methodology, allowing fast execution of motion plans for systems with a high number of degrees of freedom.},

abstract={For a small underwater robot floating in water, it is impossible to position the arm precisely only with the arm actuator, because the body is moved by the action of a fluid drag force and an inertial force acting on the arm. In this study, the positioning of the arm using a redundant counter arm and an internal reaction wheel is proposed for suppressing the flow disturbance around the robot. The counter arm, which is located in an axially symmetrical position, is used to cancel the forces acting on the operating arm. The reaction wheel is used to cancel the moment acting on the body. The arm positioning system using these actuators for the floating underwater robot is developed based on the optimal control theory. The performance of this system was confirmed by experimental models. It was shown that the counter arm and the reaction wheel are very effective for the precise positioning of the arm. © 1994, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, this DCC is applied to the motion control of an unconstrained robot in water, regarding fluid force as a disturbance, and its effectiveness is considered by computer simulations. As a result, it was made clear that the DCC is very useful for the motion control of an unconstrained robot in water, because the fluid reaction forces which are very difficult to estimate can be regarded as disturbances, and also that a low-pass filter is useful for the measurement of noise to estimate the disturbance torque which is equal to the minimum-order observer using the Gopinath method. © 1994, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

abstract={A rapid sorting technique with a wide range of applications has been developed and performance tested. The applications include path planning for complex manipulators with many degrees of freedom and autonomous under water vehicles. This paper describes the results and trade-offs behind the design and implementation phases during hardware and software development. The presented sorting technique is particularly useful as a collision checking, or conversely homing, subroutine in path planning in complex and dynamic environments.},

abstract={This paper has presented early ideas and results for implementing an automated dual arm subsea inspection/intervention system designed to interact at the task level. The feasibility of using a low order linear model to represent the dynamics of the shoulder up/down joint of a TA9 manipulator has been demonstrated. An alternative approach to solving the kinematic motion equations has also been identified, and initial trials of the multi-agent structure carried out. The Preference Planning approach to interleaving task planning and execution for error recovery has been designed and is being implemented.},
