@article{Wei2018,
abstract = {In a future intelligent factory, a robotic manipulator must work efficiently and safely in a Humanâ€“Robot collaborative and dynamic unstructured environment. Autonomous path planning is the most important issue which must be resolved first in the process of improving robotic manipulator intelligence. Among the path-planning methods, the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm based on random sampling has been widely applied in dynamic path planning for a high-dimensional robotic manipulator, especially in a complex environment because of its probability completeness, perfect expansion, and fast exploring speed over other planning methods. However, the existing RRT algorithm has a limitation in path planning for a robotic manipulator in a dynamic unstructured environment. Therefore, an autonomous obstacle avoidance dynamic path-planning method for a robotic manipulator based on an improved RRT algorithm, called Smoothly RRT (S-RRT), is proposed. This method that targets a directional node extends and can increase the sampling speed and efficiency of RRT dramatically. A path optimization strategy based on the maximum curvature constraint is presented to generate a smooth and curved continuous executable path for a robotic manipulator. Finally, the correctness, effectiveness, and practicability of the proposed method are demonstrated and validated via a MATLAB static simulation and a Robot Operating System (ROS) dynamic simulation environment as well as a real autonomous obstacle avoidance experiment in a dynamic unstructured environment for a robotic manipulator. The proposed method not only provides great practical engineering significance for a robotic manipulator's obstacle avoidance in an intelligent factory, but also theoretical reference value for other type of robots' path planning.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel and general real-time adaptive motion planning (RAMP) approach suitable for planning trajectories of high-DOF or redundant robots, such as mobile manipulators, in dynamic environments with moving obstacles of unknown trajectories. The RAMP approach enables simultaneous path and trajectory planning and simultaneous planning and execution of motion in real time. It facilitates real-time optimization of trajectories under various optimization criteria, such as minimizing energy and time and maximizing manipulability. It also accommodates partially specified task goals of robots easily. The approach exploits redundancy in redundant robots (such as locomotion versus manipulation in a mobile manipulator) through loose coupling of robot configuration variables to best achieve obstacle avoidance and optimization objectives. The RAMP approach has been implemented and tested in simulation over a diverse set of task environments, including environments with multiple mobile manipulators. The results (and also the accompanying video) show that the RAMP planner, with its high efficiency and flexibility, not only handles a single mobile manipulator well in dynamic environments with various obstacles of unknown motions in addition to static obstacles, but can also readily and effectively plan motions for each mobile manipulator in an environment shared by multiple mobile manipulators and other moving obstacles. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

@article{Muglikar2020,
abstract = {In modern visual SLAM systems, it is a standard practice to retrieve potential candidate map points from overlapping keyframes for further feature matching or direct tracking. In this work, we argue that keyframes are not the optimal choice for this task, due to several inherent limitations, such as weak geometric reasoning and poor scalability. We propose a voxel-map representation to efficiently retrieve map points for visual SLAM. In particular, we organize the map points in a regular voxel grid. Visible points from a camera pose are queried by sampling the camera frustum in a raycasting manner, which can be done in constant time using an efficient voxel hashing method. Compared with keyframes, the retrieved points using our method are geometrically guaranteed to fall in the camera field-of-view, and occluded points can be identified and removed to a certain extend. This method also naturally scales up to large scenes and complicated multi-camera configurations. Experimental results show that our voxel map representation is as efficient as a keyframe map with 5 keyframes and provides significantly higher localization accuracy (average 46% improvement in RMSE) on the EuRoC dataset. The proposed voxel-map representation is a general approach to a fundamental functionality in visual SLAM and widely applicable.},

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS-Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.},

In addition to this, because of the disturbance observer augmented in the proposed control law, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is enhanced to a great extent. .e feasibility of the proposed NFTSMC is conâ‚¬rmed by performing extensive numerical simulation on the UVMS for tracking a given pre-deâ‚¬ned task space trajectory under the in.uence of parameter uncertainties, ocean current and measurement sensor noises.},

abstract = {This article presents the design of a biomimetic underwater vehicle-manipulator system (BUVMS) with bioinspired long-fin propulsion and its control methods. The kinematic analysis of bioinspired long-fin propulsion is conducted, and the maximum thrust of this propulsion derived from our thrust measurement platform can be up to 25 N. Bioinspired long-fin propulsion is introduced to construct the BUVMS for inspection and manipulation tasks, and the system architecture of the BUVMS is described. Moreover, real-Time dynamic dubins-helix path planning and tracking of the biomimetic vehicle are proposed to realize the arrival of the desired pose. The tracking error is less than 0.23 body length. Finally, coordinated control between the biomimetic vehicle and the manipulator is developed to achieve autonomous manipulation. The reaction of the manipulator served as feedforward compensation is added into the closed-loop control of the biomimetic vehicle. The experimental results are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed methods.},

abstract = {A new nonlinear robust control scheme is proposed and investigated for the trajectory tracking control problem of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) using the discrete time delay estimation (DTDE) technique. The proposed control scheme mainly has two parts: The DTDE part and the desired dynamics part. The former one is applied to properly estimate and compensate the complex unknown lumped dynamics of the system, using the intentionally time-delayed system's information. The latter one is used to obtain the desired dynamic characteristic of the closed-loop control system. Thanks to the DTDE technique, the proposed control scheme no longer requires the detailed system dynamic information or the acceleration signals, bringing in good feasibility for actual applications and satisfactory control performance. The stability of the closed-loop control system is analyzed and proved using the bounded input bounded out stability theory. Finally, nine degree of freedoms (DOFs) simulation and seven DOFs pool experiment studies were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme with an UVMS developed in our laboratory. Corresponding results show that our proposed control scheme can ensure satisfactory control performance with relative small control gains and obtain a precision of 0.064 m for the end effector in the task space.},
